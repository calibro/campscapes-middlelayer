diary","timelineLabel":"Recovering an eyewitness","description":"The diary of Etty Hillesum was only published in 1979, after numerous attempts by writer Klaas Smelik, whom she entrusted with the manuscript. Hillesum, of Jewish origin worked, initially for the Jewish Council in the camp and had an opportunity to escape. She decided, however, to stay next to her family in the camp and also document the regime inside, interactions and personal despair as the fate of those insides were becoming more apparent with time. Hillesum wrote evocative accounts from it to her friends, later published as in the early 1950s as “Letters from Westerbork”. Her diary, however, a depiction of the thought and political assessment of the Netherlands before the war of an unorthodox young woman of Jewish origin in Amsterdam was a more problematic text. Her musings over complicity, responsibility and ethics challenged the perception of the victim of the Holocaust. Like Philip Mechanicus, Hillesum is, in fact, one of the rare voices of witnesses who did not survive the Shoah but left behind a critical testimony of the context and the compromises which led to mass murder. The book poses interesting questions about the type of voice telling the story of camp, not as a survivor, but as a victim who never had the opportunity to reconsider opinions at the height of the social polarisation.","startDate":"1970-01-01","endDate":"1970-01-02","year":"1970","latitude":52.917784,"longitude":6.6093611,"provenance":"The Westerbork Memorial","files":[{"id":744,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/744","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T08:20:44+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:05:43+00:00","filename":"7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","authentication":"6bac9cd75a0398655cde20858451d8c3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"WBK_icon 5_Etty Hillesum diary_1970.jpg","size":63448,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":514,"resolution_y":840,"compression_ratio":0.048984003458712}},"item":{"id":2102,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2102","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":2,"exhibitId":34,"exhibitSlug":"dynamics-of-the-jewish-memory-","exhibitTitle":"Dynamics of the Jewish memory of resistance around Westerbork"},{"paragraph":6,"exhibitId":40,"exhibitSlug":"documenting-camps","exhibitTitle":"Documenting camps"},{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":44,"exhibitSlug":"intro--do-not-remove-","exhibitTitle":"intro [DO NOT REMOVE]"}]},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":742,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/742","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T08:20:39+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:05:43+00:00","filename":"2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","authentication":"f0e47bc50d3b665b7a9f6ea1d2d397f0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"WBK_icon 1_ Commander House_1939.jpg","size":53322,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":463,"resolution_y":334,"compression_ratio":0.11493643382781}},"item":{"id":2099,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2099","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T08:20:38+00:00","modified":"2019-10-30T09:36:13+00:00","item_type":"icon","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2099","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":2,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2099","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"The “Commander House” in Westerbork, the Netherlands","timelineLabel":"Canonizing the memorial site","description":"Walking on the Westerbork site today, the “commander house” is the most visible element and also the one structure which has never been removed, revamped or torn down in the successive interventions on the site. It sits under a glass case, as a particularly precious exhibit. All camp commanders after 1941 inhabited the house, including the name indelibly linked to the Westerbork camp, Albert Konrad Gemmeker. After the war, the house was linked to the colonial history of the Netherlands, through col. Van der Speck O’Breen, a former officer in the Dutch Army in Indonesia who, as the new territorial commander, was assigned duties concerning the temporary habitation of the Moluccan group. Initially built by day wagers, many of them Jewish refugees, working to survive in Drenthe, the house is historically significant for the rights, exclusion and perception of refugees in the Netherlands and how the regime of detention for protection gradually turned into a space of concentration and the Holocaust. A symbol of power for most living in the nearby camp, before, during and after the war, it was a vehicle of a spatial organisation of power and hierarchy by means of demarcations. All through the existence of any form of camp, it spoke about a process of denationalization or statelessness for refugees, inmates and the temporary inhabitants of Schattenberg. It was inevitably a space of power for the various individuals who lived in the camp. Inmates in the camp would refer to it as the “outside”. These connotations reinforced the oppositions which make a camp: between “citizens” and “strangers”, “natives” and “migrants”, “residents” and “occupiers”. The story of the former “Commander’s” house tells us a lot about the physical existence designated who was an inmate and who held authority and how. What are the implications of memorialization when the most visible element on the site is the “the heritage” of power and the perpetrator?","year":"2013","latitude":52.9175,"longitude":6.6031944,"provenance":"The Westerbork Memorial","startDate":"2013-01-01","endDate":"2013-01-01","files":[{"id":742,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/742","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T08:20:39+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:05:43+00:00","filename":"2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","authentication":"f0e47bc50d3b665b7a9f6ea1d2d397f0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"WBK_icon 1_ Commander House_1939.jpg","size":53322,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":463,"resolution_y":334,"compression_ratio":0.11493643382781}},"item":{"id":2099,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2099","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":1,"exhibitId":32,"exhibitSlug":"representing-perpetrators-thro","exhibitTitle":"Representing perpetrators through heritage"},{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":44,"exhibitSlug":"intro--do-not-remove-","exhibitTitle":"intro [DO NOT REMOVE]"}]},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":768,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/768","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/fe6fc18b01df3335d15c6a6c49a1277a.pdf","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/fe6fc18b01df3335d15c6a6c49a1277a.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/fe6fc18b01df3335d15c6a6c49a1277a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/fe6fc18b01df3335d15c6a6c49a1277a.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T16:09:31+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:05:13+00:00","filename":"fe6fc18b01df3335d15c6a6c49a1277a.pdf","authentication":"08085d31c75cfb7be2de5d4c8b12df6e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"application/pdf","order":null,"original_filename":"RGC-letter-1945.pdf","size":875284,"stored":true,"type_os":"PDF document, version 1.6","metadata":{"mime_type":"application/pdf"},"item":{"id":2084,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2084","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:25:25+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T16:09:32+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2084","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":228,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/228","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Van Cleef's letter to her mother, 1945","description":"After her liberation in camp Liebau, Ronnie Goldstein-van Cleef wrote a letter to her mother. “Mother, now I have returned to life.

I ate grass, mother. That was really bad, but I was so […] hungry. […] May blazed as it has never blazed, and never ever have I felt full life blossoming as now. I pushed aside my fear of whether I'd find my way back at all. I just ask god every day again, that he keeps you well and gives me the power to be able to care for you and be that for you what you always had wished earlier.
