Wagenaar found out that the name of the girl, Settela Steinbach, hides, in fact, another story. The nine-year-old girl was, in fact, part of the Sinti community from the Southern Netherlands. She was brought to Westerbork as a result of \"razzias\" in Eindhoven. She survived in Auschwitz for only two months. Wagenaar's discovery of this case of mistaken identity is emblematic for the silences concerning the Roma Holocaust everywhere in Europe. The contrast between this anonymous victim and the iconic status of Anne Frank, another child icon, coming however from a very different social class, represents a stark discrepancy in the visibility of memorialised victims.","year":"1994","copyright":"Publisher's advertising.","timelineLabel":"Giving back an identity","startDate":"1994-01-01","endDate":"1995-01-01","files":[{"id":647,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/647","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/202965ed13898c749508a74656b13558.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/202965ed13898c749508a74656b13558.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/202965ed13898c749508a74656b13558.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/202965ed13898c749508a74656b13558.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T07:18:39+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:03:58+00:00","filename":"202965ed13898c749508a74656b13558.jpg","authentication":"e4275cc89fb6cea9dd7e525b301f30c3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"HM-settela-book.jpg","size":63242,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":448,"resolution_y":553,"compression_ratio":0.085090523551193}},"item":{"id":1955,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1955","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"relations":{},"subjectsRelations":{"site":[{"id":2086,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2086","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:46:13+00:00","modified":"2019-10-31T09:41:59+00:00","item_type":"site","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2086","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":9,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2086","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Westerbork","description":"The Westerbork camp in the Netherlands testifies to overlapping histories of politics of exclusion and inclusion. It was established in 1939, after the Dutch borders were closed down for refugees by the government, as a central refugee camp for Jews who fled from Germany and Anschluss Austria. In total, after Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933, almost 32,000 German Jews found refuge in the Netherlands, some 10,000 after the 1938 November or Kristallnacht pogroms. At the beginning of the German occupation in May 1940 it hosted only 750 refugees, but when the Nazis turned the refugee camp into a transit camp in July 1942 the camp was enlarged with new barracks for Dutch Jews. Already since February 1941 Dutch and German Jews were caught by Nazi raids (razzia’s) in the Amsterdam Judenviertel and in other cities, but from July 1942 until the beginning of the railway strike of September 1944 the Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager Westerbork served that function. In close cooperation with the Amsterdam Jewish Council (Joodse Raad) at about 107,000 (of a total of 145,000 Dutch Jews), and 245 Sinti and Roma, of 97 transports were selected for weekly deportations to concentration and extermination camps in Germany and Eastern Europe, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau and Sobibor. The façade of a seemingly peaceful place where people waited in fear on the deadly transports was described in painful details by the Dutch journalist Philip Mechanicus in his camp diary In Depot and in the letters and diaries of Etty Hillesum, and filmed by the German-Jewish photographer Rudolf Breslauer for his 1944 Westerbork film, of which the footage (since 2017 registered as UNESCO Memory of the World) contains the only known real-life moving images of a Nazi train transport. Only 5,000 deportees survived the war. After Poland, the Germans were nowhere more successful in the extermination of Jews than in the Netherlands.  Yet the camp was controlled by only a few German SS officers, with help of some SS trained volunteers from German and Amsterdam police battalions and the Dutch Waffen SS, housed in the nearby SS camp Hooghalen, or Heidelager. The Dutch military police (Marechaussee) continued to guard the camp inside, assisted by a Jewish camp police. The latter, the OD (Ordnungsdienst), distinctive in their green overalls (since 1943) who had to help with the transports, garnered the worst reputation among Dutch Jewish inmates as the ‘Jewish SS’.  Westerbork underwent a new transformation after the liberation, when between 1945 and 1948 it came to serve as an internment camp for members of the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB), SS volunteers and other people suspected of having collaborated with the Nazis. It also briefly served as a training base for soldiers during the Indonesian War of Independence  (1945-1949) and a camp for Dutch repatriates from the Dutch Indies. From 1951 to 1970 the camp, renamed Schattenberg, became the residence of a large part of former Moluccan soldiers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army  (KNIL) with their families, who left the island of Ambon after the Indonesian repression of their independence movement. Two decades after living in the camp, the Moluccans saw their camp demolished after the government approved the project of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on the campscape. The Schattenberg community was relocated to surrounding villages. With the exception of the camp commander’s house and the 1949 Resistance Monument, the campscape was already half empty when in 1970 the National Monument Camp Westerbork was unveiled, and in 1983, three kilometres away from the silence zone, the Memorial Centre  Camp Westerbork was opened. From then on Jewish survivors held regular commemorations and the annual number of visitors rose constantly, reaching 180,000 in 2019. Since 2000 the Memorial Center has made room for research and presentations on the wider biography of the site, but confronted itself in 2008 with strong protests against its temporary exhibition of the NSB period, after which the museum and the “holy ground” of the campscape have become separated spaces, the latter mainly dedicated to Holocaust commemoration. Yet, within the current context of a growing competition of Holocaust and postcolonial memories, and the refugee issue, the memorialization of the various groups which went through Westerbork and Schattenberg, and their divergent experiences including the role of the perpetrators, remains contested up to today.

It sits under a glass case, as a particularly precious exhibit. All camp commanders after 1941 inhabited the house, including the name indelibly linked to the Westerbork camp, Albert Konrad Gemmeker. After the war, the house was linked to the colonial history of the Netherlands, through col. Van der Speck O’Breen, a former officer in the Dutch Army in Indonesia who, as the new territorial commander, was assigned duties concerning the temporary habitation of the Moluccan group. Initially built by day wagers, many of them Jewish refugees, working to survive in Drenthe, the house is historically significant for the rights, exclusion and perception of refugees in the Netherlands and how the regime of detention for protection gradually turned into a space of concentration and the Holocaust. A symbol of power for most living in the nearby camp, before, during and after the war, it was a vehicle of a spatial organisation of power and hierarchy by means of demarcations. All through the existence of any form of camp, it spoke about a process of denationalization or statelessness for refugees, inmates and the temporary inhabitants of Schattenberg. It was inevitably a space of power for the various individuals who lived in the camp. Inmates in the camp would refer to it as the “outside”. These connotations reinforced the oppositions which make a camp: between “citizens” and “strangers”, “natives” and “migrants”, “residents” and “occupiers”. The story of the former “Commander’s” house tells us a lot about the physical existence designated who was an inmate and who held authority and how. What are the implications of memorialization when the most visible element on the site is the “the heritage” of power and the perpetrator?","year":"2013","latitude":52.9175,"longitude":6.6031944,"provenance":"The Westerbork Memorial","startDate":"2013-01-01","endDate":"2013-01-01","files":[{"id":742,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/742","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T08:20:39+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:05:43+00:00","filename":"2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","authentication":"f0e47bc50d3b665b7a9f6ea1d2d397f0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"WBK_icon 1_ Commander House_1939.jpg","size":53322,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":463,"resolution_y":334,"compression_ratio":0.11493643382781}},"item":{"id":2099,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2099","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"relations":{},"subjectsRelations":{"site":[{"id":2086,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2086","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:46:13+00:00","modified":"2019-10-31T09:41:59+00:00","item_type":"site","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2086","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":9,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2086","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Westerbork","description":"The Westerbork camp in the Netherlands testifies to overlapping histories of politics of exclusion and inclusion.

The film was commissioned by the commander of the camp, Albert Gemmeker, who meant, most probably, to produce a professional record of the economic value of the facility. Breslauer documented the Tuesday train transports to other concentration camps, though most images picture ‘moments of normalcy’; healthy men and women working in workshops, playing sports, children at school, or scenes at the hospital, cabaret and even a church service. Next to stills showing the orderly camp, the productive daily labour and even football matches in the camp, the film follows trains and transports, the horror of anonymous faces, of all ages, some starving, some still unknowing as the trains depart. Breslauer never got to finalise the Westerbork film, but much of the raw footage is preserved, in different versions. Since 1948, fragments of the film are widely used in documentaries, films and newsreels and as evidence in the postwar trial against Gemmeker. Footage of the transports, especially the scene of the Dutch Sinti girl Settela Steinbach who looks at the lens behind the doors of a boxcar, became iconic for the systematic anonymization of the victims of the Nazis. The film remains the only filmed documentation of a concentration camp during the war.

Westerbork underwent a new transformation after the liberation, when between 1945 and 1948 it came to serve as an internment camp for members of the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB), SS volunteers and other people suspected of having collaborated with the Nazis. It also briefly served as a training base for soldiers during the Indonesian War of Independence  (1945-1949) and a camp for Dutch repatriates from the Dutch Indies. From 1951 to 1970 the camp, renamed Schattenberg, became the residence of a large part of former Moluccan soldiers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army  (KNIL) with their families, who left the island of Ambon after the Indonesian repression of their independence movement. Two decades after living in the camp, the Moluccans saw their camp demolished after the government approved the project of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on the campscape. The Schattenberg community was relocated to surrounding villages. With the exception of the camp commander’s house and the 1949 Resistance Monument, the campscape was already half empty when in 1970 the National Monument Camp Westerbork was unveiled, and in 1983, three kilometres away from the silence zone, the Memorial Centre  Camp Westerbork was opened. From then on Jewish survivors held regular commemorations and the annual number of visitors rose constantly, reaching 180,000 in 2019. Since 2000 the Memorial Center has made room for research and presentations on the wider biography of the site, but confronted itself in 2008 with strong protests against its temporary exhibition of the NSB period, after which the museum and the “holy ground” of the campscape have become separated spaces, the latter mainly dedicated to Holocaust commemoration. Yet, within the current context of a growing competition of Holocaust and postcolonial memories, and the refugee issue, the memorialization of the various groups which went through Westerbork and Schattenberg, and their divergent experiences including the role of the perpetrators, remains contested up to today.

Hillesum, of Jewish origin worked, initially for the Jewish Council in the camp and had an opportunity to escape. She decided, however, to stay next to her family in the camp and also document the regime inside, interactions and personal despair as the fate of those insides were becoming more apparent with time. Hillesum wrote evocative accounts from it to her friends, later published as in the early 1950s as “Letters from Westerbork”. Her diary, however, a depiction of the thought and political assessment of the Netherlands before the war of an unorthodox young woman of Jewish origin in Amsterdam was a more problematic text. Her musings over complicity, responsibility and ethics challenged the perception of the victim of the Holocaust. Like Philip Mechanicus, Hillesum is, in fact, one of the rare voices of witnesses who did not survive the Shoah but left behind a critical testimony of the context and the compromises which led to mass murder. The book poses interesting questions about the type of voice telling the story of camp, not as a survivor, but as a victim who never had the opportunity to reconsider opinions at the height of the social polarisation.","startDate":"1970-01-01","endDate":"1970-01-02","year":"1970","latitude":52.917784,"longitude":6.6093611,"provenance":"The Westerbork Memorial","files":[{"id":744,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/744","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T08:20:44+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:05:43+00:00","filename":"7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","authentication":"6bac9cd75a0398655cde20858451d8c3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"WBK_icon 5_Etty Hillesum diary_1970.jpg","size":63448,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":514,"resolution_y":840,"compression_ratio":0.048984003458712}},"item":{"id":2102,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2102","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"relations":{},"subjectsRelations":{"site":[{"id":2086,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2086","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:46:13+00:00","modified":"2019-10-31T09:41:59+00:00","item_type":"site","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2086","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":9,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2086","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Westerbork","description":"The Westerbork camp in the Netherlands testifies to overlapping histories of politics of exclusion and inclusion. It was established in 1939, after the Dutch borders were closed down for refugees by the government, as a central refugee camp for Jews who fled from Germany and Anschluss Austria. In total, after Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933, almost 32,000 German Jews found refuge in the Netherlands, some 10,000 after the 1938 November or Kristallnacht pogroms. At the beginning of the German occupation in May 1940 it hosted only 750 refugees, but when the Nazis turned the refugee camp into a transit camp in July 1942 the camp was enlarged with new barracks for Dutch Jews. Already since February 1941 Dutch and German Jews were caught by Nazi raids (razzia’s) in the Amsterdam Judenviertel and in other cities, but from July 1942 until the beginning of the railway strike of September 1944 the Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager Westerbork served that function. In close cooperation with the Amsterdam Jewish Council (Joodse Raad) at about 107,000 (of a total of 145,000 Dutch Jews), and 245 Sinti and Roma, of 97 transports were selected for weekly deportations to concentration and extermination camps in Germany and Eastern Europe, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau and Sobibor. The façade of a seemingly peaceful place where people waited in fear on the deadly transports was described in painful details by the Dutch journalist Philip Mechanicus in his camp diary In Depot and in the letters and diaries of Etty Hillesum, and filmed by the German-Jewish photographer Rudolf Breslauer for his 1944 Westerbork film, of which the footage (since 2017 registered as UNESCO Memory of the World) contains the only known real-life moving images of a Nazi train transport. Only 5,000 deportees survived the war. After Poland, the Germans were nowhere more successful in the extermination of Jews than in the Netherlands.  Yet the camp was controlled by only a few German SS officers, with help of some SS trained volunteers from German and Amsterdam police battalions and the Dutch Waffen SS, housed in the nearby SS camp Hooghalen, or Heidelager. The Dutch military police (Marechaussee) continued to guard the camp inside, assisted by a Jewish camp police.

Jasenovac camp in Croatia testifies to the ways in which national authoritarian movements thrived in Europe in the shadow of Nazi Germany and to their enduring influence on contemporary social and political divisions. During the war, Jasenovac was the largest complex of concentration, incarceration, forced labour and death camps scattered in the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska - NDH), a fascist puppet state. Between 1941 and 1945, the Roman-Catholic Croatian Ustaše with the help of their followers (among them Bosnian Muslims recruited by the Waffen SS) systematically exterminated Jews, Roma, Serbs, Croats and others who opposed Ustaše ideology.  Although contested and subject to continuous politically charged debates, the number of (registered) victims of Jasenovac currently established by the Croat Jasenovac Memorial Site stands at 83,811.\r\nAfter WWII and the imposition of state socialism in Yugoslavia, the camp came to symbolize the “glorious anti-fascist struggle” captured in Tito’s slogan of “Brotherhood and Unity”, which aimed to aid postwar inter-ethnic consensus. This was reflected in the now-iconic “Stone Flower” monument designed by Bogdan Bogdanovic which was inaugurated, along with a museum, at the location of the former Camp III (Brickworks) in 1968. Although Jasenovac was the most important site of commemoration in Yugoslavia, the nature of the regime did not allow sufficient agency for independent scholarship related to this campscape and the crimes of WWII in general. In the wake of new wars in the 1990s, the number of Jasenovac victims (which had already been overestimated since 1946 in order to justify large wartime reparations from Germany), soon became a key element in the political use of memory. In the 1980s and 1990s, new national tensions in the former Yugoslavia came to be analysed through the prism of past conflicts, creating a new set of propaganda activities and manipulations with regards to the number of victims and visual representations of the Jasenovac tragedy. In 1988, a second permanent exhibition was opened, full of nationalist undertones that fueled ethnic tensions and divisions between Serbs and Croats. This exhibition was demolished during the 1990s dissolution wars. At the same time, the former camp Stara Gradiška (one of Jasenovac’s sub camps) with its torture centre “Hotel Gagro”, was reused as a prison camp in Yugoslavia and as a camp during the 1990s.\r\nAfter the 1990s wars, the contested legacy of Jasenovac continued to be reflected in the spatial division of the terrain of the former main camp, located on two sides of the River Sava - a national border established in 1991 - which nowadays marks the boundary between Croatia and Republika Srpska, a predominantly Serbian part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the accession of Croatia to the European Union in 2013, this border further separates - politically and symbolically - the 28th EU member state from other countries in the former Yugoslavia. A new permanent exhibition opened in 2006 on the Croatian side at the Jasenovac Memorial Site. On the Republika Srpska side, the Donja Gradina Memorial encapsulates the largest mass killing and mass burial site of the Jasenovac complex, with more than 150 marked and unmarked graves. Established in the 1980s, the site still informs visitors that 700,000 people were murdered in Jasenovac, a figure based on statistics already instrumentalized by Serbian politics in the 1980s and used to wage war against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the 1990s, right-wing Croatian nationalists and Holocaust deniers have continued to downgrade the number of Jasenovac victims and the nature of the camp. They have also suggested that Jasenovac was a postwar communist camp housing a higher number of prisoners than the Ustaše camp, even though the Brickworks camp was already demolished in 1945. The Jasenovac Memorial Site nowadays promotes the individualization of victims as an alternative to the former politicization of the past and the use of photos showing mass deaths. However, in doing so, it finds itself regularly confronted with revisionist responses to the past.   \r\n","files":[]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":47,"exhibitSlug":"visualising-stara-gradi--ka---","exhibitTitle":"Visualising Stara Gradiška’s Penal Landscape"},{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":50,"exhibitSlug":"trials-to-dinko---aki---and---","exhibitTitle":"Trials to Dinko Šakić and Živan Kuveždić: evaluating transitional justice"},{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":51,"exhibitSlug":"suffering-of-the-roma-in-the-i","exhibitTitle":"Suffering of the Roma in the Independent State of Croatia: Forgotten People on the Sidelines of Croatian History"},{"paragraph":1,"exhibitId":52,"exhibitSlug":"the-war-on-numbers--the-presen","exhibitTitle":"The war on numbers: the presence of Jasenovac in Serbian and Croatian politics of memory"}]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":9,"exhibitId":47,"exhibitSlug":"visualising-stara-gradi--ka---","exhibitTitle":"Visualising Stara Gradiška’s Penal Landscape"}]},{"id":2257,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2257","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-11-07T11:00:38+00:00","modified":"2019-11-19T12:15:19+00:00","item_type":"icon","collection":null,"owner":{"id":30,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/30","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2257","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":242,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/242","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Ilija Jakovljević, Konclogor na Savi (memoarska proza), 1999\r\nIlija Jakovljevic, Concentration camp on river Sava (memoir on Stara Gradiska), 1999","description":"testimony of Ilija Jakovljevic on \"hotel Gagro\" given through his memoir literature","startDate":"1999","endDate":"1999","copyright":"Jasenovac Memorial Site (library)","files":[{"id":896,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/896","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/b6c4a72f14dc43ee879a8fe81c459652.pdf","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-11-11T13:35:15+00:00","modified":"2019-11-19T12:15:19+00:00","filename":"b6c4a72f14dc43ee879a8fe81c459652.pdf","authentication":"cafe45eb58221c59273e2e20b7778be4","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"application/pdf","order":null,"original_filename":"Jakovljevic.pdf","size":7061754,"stored":true,"type_os":"PDF document, version 1.6","metadata":{"mime_type":"application/pdf"},"item":{"id":2257,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2257","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"relations":{},"subjectsRelations":{"site":[{"id":2208,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2208","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-10-14T15:26:15+00:00","modified":"2019-11-02T21:04:40+00:00","item_type":"site","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2208","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":4,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2208","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Jasenovac","siteName":"Jasenovac","country":"Croatia","latitude":45.27096,"longitude":16.93078,"inceptionDate":"1941-08-01","description":"The Jasenovac camp in Croatia testifies to the ways in which national authoritarian movements thrived in Europe in the shadow of Nazi Germany and to their enduring influence on contemporary social and political divisions.

This camp serves as an example of how the concealed and recent traumatic past in Spain has mobilized the claims of victims’ groups, activists, historical memory associations, political parties and academics for the implementation of an official memory and memorialization politics that recognizes and addresses the experience of victims of Francoist violence.\r\nIn March 1939, before the imminent end of the war, the rebel Francoist army used two battalions of republican workers (POW) for the construction of the camp. The camp functioned for one year, between March 1939 and 1940. Its main functions were the classification, reeducation and elimination of those considered the enemies of the new regime after the coup d’état against the legitimate government of the Second Republic (1931-1939) on 17 July 1936. It has been estimated that between 15,000 to 20,000 prisoners went through the camp, which included civilians and militaries from different regions of the country. \r\nInside the Camp, detainees were segregated into different barracks. Political personalities shared the space with left-wing trade union leaders, republican council officials, army officers and members of guerrilla groups, among others. Many of them were executed as part of the political cleansing carried out by the new authorities. All traces of them were lost in the concentration camp. The inmates that survived were often (re)integrated into the social fabric of the so-called “New Spain” through forced labor and a process of “re-education.” Thousands of them embarked on a journey, which, in the best-case scenario, took them to other concentration camps, prisons or forced labour camps. These repressive centres utilized a technology of pain to realize their aims of humiliation and punishment. Starvation, illness, epidemics and torture characterized the living conditions in the camps and prisons. \r\nIn January 1940, a small group of inmates escaped from the camp and arrived in France. Far from the fate they expected, they were once again turned into prisoners, detained in a different concentration camp and forced to integrate the Foreign Legion or workers’ battalions. Other half-million Spaniards who fled to France trying to escape from Franco's repression suffered the same fate. Nearly 14,000 Spanish refugees died due to the extreme conditions of the French camps. From here, more than 9,000 prisoners were sent to Nazi concentration camps, and approximately 5,500 died throughout Europe. \r\nThe infrastructure of the camp in Castuera was dismantled at the beginning of April 1940. After it ceased to operate, the camp fell into oblivion, undergoing a similar process to those who endured its violence during the dictatorship. With the “pact of forgetting” and the Amnesty Law of 1977 the silence over the episodes that took place at the site continued throughout part of the current democratic period. In 2004, the screening of the documentary “The nightmare of Castuera” to a primetime television audience marked a turning point in the visibility of the camp. From this moment, the Association for the Memory of Castuera Concentration Camp has led the most important actions connected to the memory and recognition of the camp and the victims of Francoist repression in the area. In 2009, after high pressure from the civil society and academics, the privately own land of the camp received the most important heritage protection classification in Spain as Site of Cultural Interest. Despite its new official categorization, the area continues to be used for extensive stockbreeding today.\r\nArchaeological investigations undertaken at the site between 2010 and 2012 and the exhumations of two mass graves that contained the corpses of prisoners from the camp have revealed important information about the functioning of the site and the repressive processes suffered by prisoners.

This camp serves as an example of how the concealed and recent traumatic past in Spain has mobilized the claims of victims’ groups, activists, historical memory associations, political parties and academics for the implementation of an official memory and memorialization politics that recognizes and addresses the experience of victims of Francoist violence.\r\nIn March 1939, before the imminent end of the war, the rebel Francoist army used two battalions of republican workers (POW) for the construction of the camp. The camp functioned for one year, between March 1939 and 1940. Its main functions were the classification, reeducation and elimination of those considered the enemies of the new regime after the coup d’état against the legitimate government of the Second Republic (1931-1939) on 17 July 1936. It has been estimated that between 15,000 to 20,000 prisoners went through the camp, which included civilians and militaries from different regions of the country. \r\nInside the Camp, detainees were segregated into different barracks. Political personalities shared the space with left-wing trade union leaders, republican council officials, army officers and members of guerrilla groups, among others. Many of them were executed as part of the political cleansing carried out by the new authorities. All traces of them were lost in the concentration camp. The inmates that survived were often (re)integrated into the social fabric of the so-called “New Spain” through forced labor and a process of “re-education.” Thousands of them embarked on a journey, which, in the best-case scenario, took them to other concentration camps, prisons or forced labour camps. These repressive centres utilized a technology of pain to realize their aims of humiliation and punishment. Starvation, illness, epidemics and torture characterized the living conditions in the camps and prisons. \r\nIn January 1940, a small group of inmates escaped from the camp and arrived in France. Far from the fate they expected, they were once again turned into prisoners, detained in a different concentration camp and forced to integrate the Foreign Legion or workers’ battalions. Other half-million Spaniards who fled to France trying to escape from Franco's repression suffered the same fate. Nearly 14,000 Spanish refugees died due to the extreme conditions of the French camps. From here, more than 9,000 prisoners were sent to Nazi concentration camps, and approximately 5,500 died throughout Europe. \r\nThe infrastructure of the camp in Castuera was dismantled at the beginning of April 1940. After it ceased to operate, the camp fell into oblivion, undergoing a similar process to those who endured its violence during the dictatorship. With the “pact of forgetting” and the Amnesty Law of 1977 the silence over the episodes that took place at the site continued throughout part of the current democratic period. In 2004, the screening of the documentary “The nightmare of Castuera” to a primetime television audience marked a turning point in the visibility of the camp. From this moment, the Association for the Memory of Castuera Concentration Camp has led the most important actions connected to the memory and recognition of the camp and the victims of Francoist repression in the area. In 2009, after high pressure from the civil society and academics, the privately own land of the camp received the most important heritage protection classification in Spain as Site of Cultural Interest. Despite its new official categorization, the area continues to be used for extensive stockbreeding today.\r\nArchaeological investigations undertaken at the site between 2010 and 2012 and the exhumations of two mass graves that contained the corpses of prisoners from the camp have revealed important information about the functioning of the site and the repressive processes suffered by prisoners. In January 2019, a new law was approved for the recognition of the victims and the implementation of a specific memory politics in the region of Extremadura. However, despite these new developments, the place remains invisible in the space where it exists, unfathomed in the collective memory of society still today. The camp in Castuera, as it is the case for all of Franco’s concentration camps, still awaits the creation of a documentation centre intended to interpret and disseminate the history and memory of the repression exerted inside and outside its fences.","files":[]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":49,"exhibitSlug":"unearthing-the-hidden-past-in-","exhibitTitle":"Unearthing the hidden past in Castuera concentration camp"}]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":7,"exhibitId":49,"exhibitSlug":"unearthing-the-hidden-past-in-","exhibitTitle":"Unearthing the hidden past in Castuera concentration camp"}]},{"id":2306,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2306","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-11-19T12:33:07+00:00","modified":"2019-11-20T12:55:54+00:00","item_type":"icon","collection":null,"owner":{"id":24,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/24","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2306","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2306","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"The Stone Flower Monument, Jasenovac Memorial Site","timelineLabel":"the Stone Flower","startDate":"1995","endDate":"1995","copyright":"Jasenovac Memorial Site","description":"Photo by Damir Kalogjera, 2006","files":[{"id":945,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/945","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/bbe478c10bb5d18eaa196ac76152a994.jpg","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-11-20T12:55:53+00:00","modified":"2019-11-20T12:55:54+00:00","filename":"bbe478c10bb5d18eaa196ac76152a994.jpg","authentication":"c3368bfc33ef74c54a4c55249b4465b2","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"DSCF3197.jpg","size":8029434,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2848,"resolution_y":4256,"compression_ratio":0.22081169611177},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"bbe478c10bb5d18eaa196ac76152a994.jpg","FileDateTime":1574254553,"FileSize":8029434,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2848\" height=\"4256\"","Height":4256,"Width":2848,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1},"IFD0":{"NewSubFile":0,"ImageWidth":2848,"ImageLength":4256,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"Compression":1,"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"FUJIFILM","Model":"FinePix S3Pro","StripOffsets":20878,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"RowsPerStrip":4256,"StripByteCounts":36363264,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"PlanarConfiguration":1,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"paint.net 4.1.1","DateTime":"2006:11:15 23:52:50"}}}},"item":{"id":2306,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2306","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"relations":{},"subjectsRelations":{"site":[{"id":2208,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2208","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-10-14T15:26:15+00:00","modified":"2019-11-02T21:04:40+00:00","item_type":"site","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2208","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":4,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2208","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Jasenovac","siteName":"Jasenovac","country":"Croatia","latitude":45.27096,"longitude":16.93078,"inceptionDate":"1941-08-01","description":"The Jasenovac camp in Croatia testifies to the ways in which national authoritarian movements thrived in Europe in the shadow of Nazi Germany and to their enduring influence on contemporary social and political divisions. During the war, Jasenovac was the largest complex of concentration, incarceration, forced labour and death camps scattered in the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska - NDH), a fascist puppet state. Between 1941 and 1945, the Roman-Catholic Croatian Ustaše with the help of their followers (among them Bosnian Muslims recruited by the Waffen SS) systematically exterminated Jews, Roma, Serbs, Croats and others who opposed Ustaše ideology.  Although contested and subject to continuous politically charged debates, the number of (registered) victims of Jasenovac currently established by the Croat Jasenovac Memorial Site stands at 83,811.\r\nAfter WWII and the imposition of state socialism in Yugoslavia, the camp came to symbolize the “glorious anti-fascist struggle” captured in Tito’s slogan of “Brotherhood and Unity”, which aimed to aid postwar inter-ethnic consensus. This was reflected in the now-iconic “Stone Flower” monument designed by Bogdan Bogdanovic which was inaugurated, along with a museum, at the location of the former Camp III (Brickworks) in 1968. Although Jasenovac was the most important site of commemoration in Yugoslavia, the nature of the regime did not allow sufficient agency for independent scholarship related to this campscape and the crimes of WWII in general. In the wake of new wars in the 1990s, the number of Jasenovac victims (which had already been overestimated since 1946 in order to justify large wartime reparations from Germany), soon became a key element in the political use of memory. In the 1980s and 1990s, new national tensions in the former Yugoslavia came to be analysed through the prism of past conflicts, creating a new set of propaganda activities and manipulations with regards to the number of victims and visual representations of the Jasenovac tragedy. In 1988, a second permanent exhibition was opened, full of nationalist undertones that fueled ethnic tensions and divisions between Serbs and Croats. This exhibition was demolished during the 1990s dissolution wars. At the same time, the former camp Stara Gradiška (one of Jasenovac’s sub camps) with its torture centre “Hotel Gagro”, was reused as a prison camp in Yugoslavia and as a camp during the 1990s.\r\nAfter the 1990s wars, the contested legacy of Jasenovac continued to be reflected in the spatial division of the terrain of the former main camp, located on two sides of the River Sava - a national border established in 1991 - which nowadays marks the boundary between Croatia and Republika Srpska, a predominantly Serbian part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the accession of Croatia to the European Union in 2013, this border further separates - politically and symbolically - the 28th EU member state from other countries in the former Yugoslavia. A new permanent exhibition opened in 2006 on the Croatian side at the Jasenovac Memorial Site. On the Republika Srpska side, the Donja Gradina Memorial encapsulates the largest mass killing and mass burial site of the Jasenovac complex, with more than 150 marked and unmarked graves. Established in the 1980s, the site still informs visitors that 700,000 people were murdered in Jasenovac, a figure based on statistics already instrumentalized by Serbian politics in the 1980s and used to wage war against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the 1990s, right-wing Croatian nationalists and Holocaust deniers have continued to downgrade the number of Jasenovac victims and the nature of the camp. They have also suggested that Jasenovac was a postwar communist camp housing a higher number of prisoners than the Ustaše camp, even though the Brickworks camp was already demolished in 1945. The Jasenovac Memorial Site nowadays promotes the individualization of victims as an alternative to the former politicization of the past and the use of photos showing mass deaths. However, in doing so, it finds itself regularly confronted with revisionist responses to the past.   \r\n","files":[]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":47,"exhibitSlug":"visualising-stara-gradi--ka---","exhibitTitle":"Visualising Stara Gradiška’s Penal Landscape"},{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":50,"exhibitSlug":"trials-to-dinko---aki---and---","exhibitTitle":"Trials to Dinko Šakić and Živan Kuveždić: evaluating transitional justice"},{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":51,"exhibitSlug":"suffering-of-the-roma-in-the-i","exhibitTitle":"Suffering of the Roma in the Independent State of Croatia: Forgotten People on the Sidelines of Croatian History"},{"paragraph":1,"exhibitId":52,"exhibitSlug":"the-war-on-numbers--the-presen","exhibitTitle":"The war on numbers: the presence of Jasenovac in Serbian and Croatian politics of memory"}]}]},"linkedPages":[]},{"id":2307,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2307","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-11-19T13:14:38+00:00","modified":"2019-11-19T13:16:30+00:00","item_type":"icon","collection":null,"owner":{"id":24,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/24","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2307","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2307","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"\"Do not Forget About that Little Girl\", by Miroslav Barta","startDate":"1960","endDate":"1960","files":[{"id":931,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/931","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/efcc630e4ba45aaad860c98d39709817.mp4","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-11-19T13:14:38+00:00","modified":"2019-11-19T13:16:30+00:00","filename":"efcc630e4ba45aaad860c98d39709817.mp4","authentication":"31e531a23c88351b944b8cd301eb1dbe","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"video/mp4","order":null,"original_filename":"videoplayback.mp4","size":14801463,"stored":true,"type_os":"ISO Media, MPEG v4 system, version 2","metadata":{"mime_type":"video/quicktime","audio":{"dataformat":"mp4","codec":"ISO/IEC 14496-3 AAC","sample_rate":44100,"channels":2,"bits_per_sample":16,"lossless":false,"channelmode":"stereo","streams":[{"dataformat":"mp4","codec":"ISO/IEC 14496-3 AAC","sample_rate":44100,"channels":2,"bits_per_sample":16,"lossless":false,"channelmode":"stereo"}]},"video":{"dataformat":"quicktime","resolution_x":640,"resolution_y":360,"fourcc":"avc1","frame_rate":29.97},"comments":{"language":["Undetermined"]}},"item":{"id":2307,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2307","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"relations":{},"subjectsRelations":{"site":[{"id":2207,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2207","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-10-14T15:23:38+00:00","modified":"2019-11-02T21:06:39+00:00","item_type":"site","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2207","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2207","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Lety","siteName":"Lety","country":"Czech Republic","latitude":49.50958,"longitude":14.11819,"inceptionDate":"1939-03-02","description":"Lety in the Czech Republic is an important memorial location for the Roma community worldwide.

As a result of this Nazi policy, only about 10% of the pre-war Czech Roma population survived the Holocaust. The camp, which soon became overcrowded, was a holding centre from which inmates were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau in Generalgouvernement. The Protectorate Police and Gendarmerie oversaw transports. They also operated and guarded the camp. Inmates were forced to perform labour in the vicinity of Lety, including road construction, quarry works, logging and agriculture. Due to very poor hygiene and severe malnutrition, the prisoners’ health deteriorated quickly, leading to an outbreak of typhus in the winter of 1942/1943. \r\n\r\n1,309 Czech Roma passed through Lety, 327 of whom died. 101 of those who died were children under 3 years of age and this number included 28 of the 36 children born in the camp.

Established in 1940 as a penal labour camp for “asocials”, on the 1st August 1942 it was transformed into one of two internment camps (Zigeuner Lager) for all registered Roma and Sinti without permanent residence in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren), a part of Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. As a result of this Nazi policy, only about 10% of the pre-war Czech Roma population survived the Holocaust. The camp, which soon became overcrowded, was a holding centre from which inmates were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau in Generalgouvernement. The Protectorate Police and Gendarmerie oversaw transports. They also operated and guarded the camp. Inmates were forced to perform labour in the vicinity of Lety, including road construction, quarry works, logging and agriculture.

In May 1945, the Red Army used the area of the former camp as a gathering place for German Prisoners of War. In the 1970s, the local Communist government decided to establish a large cooperative industrial pig farm on the terrain of the former camp. Privatised after 1989, the industrial pig farm is still located at the site, pending demolition. In 2017, it was purchased by the state with the aim of transforming the whole area of the former camp into a memorial site.

They were a class which was not criminal per se, but also not part of the working class, the peasants or the middle class at the turn of the century, but was nevertheless stigmatized. Educational policies and schools, in Western Europe, at the turn of the century, were to contain these elements, ensuring this will be a welfarist orientation, socially-oriented form of education and care. It was, at the same time, a growing interest in social work.  The emergence of modern psychology and psychiatry lay the foundation for new perceptions of the criminal and the causes of crime (as in the case of the British jurist Jeremy Bentham). Saving and raise children rather than punishing and disciplining them meant that states were actively encouraging social measures to help individuals comply with norms of society, which were often repressive and discriminatory.  From December 1895 the reformative school in Falstad housed 50 boys, with ages ranging from 10-18 years old who had either committed crimes themselves or had been neglected, mistreated and «morally corrupted» by their parents. They were taken out of their homes and placed at Falstad, fashioned as a family structure, in a building inspired, however, by the “panopticon” model (a system of control where inhabitants cannot know when they are being watched, but they are motivated to act as though they were being monitored at all times)","startDate":"1960","endDate":"1960","files":[{"id":943,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/943","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/4fc0f9bf3a8d9c6cf432e171ff6c3b8a.jpg","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-11-20T05:26:47+00:00","modified":"2019-11-20T05:26:47+00:00","filename":"4fc0f9bf3a8d9c6cf432e171ff6c3b8a.jpg","authentication":"14ec6486e2b8ee142231d0101c364d2c","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Falstad_main_building.jpg","size":1800747,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard 2.21","metadata":0,"item":{"id":2318,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2318","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"relations":{},"subjectsRelations":{"site":[{"id":2209,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2209","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-10-14T15:29:14+00:00","modified":"2019-11-02T21:10:30+00:00","item_type":"site","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2209","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2209","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Falstad","siteName":"Falstad","country":"Norway","latitude":63.69139,"longitude":11.04156,"inceptionDate":"1921-01-01","description":"The history of the Falstad camp, tucked away in a Norwegian fjord 75 km northeast of Trondheim, speaks to the architecture of Nazi occupation in Northern Europe and its transnational dimension.

Collective memories of totalitarianism have exerted a profound influence on postwar European politics and philosophy, and two of the most prominent political theorists and public intellectuals to take up the legacy of total war were Hannah Arendt and Jürgen Habermas. Heavily contested by the community of historians in Germany in particular at the end of the 1980s, this perspective returned around 2009, when “victims of communism” were integrated into the European dimension of the remembrance of the Holocaust.  Since then, this move has been criticized as a historical relativisation of both histories of authoritarianism and a “politics of regret” where human rights also tends to dim the historical dimension of suffering as a lesson already learned.

Operational between November 1941 and its liberation in May 1945, Falstad was the largest punishment prison camp established in Central Norway. It served as a site of internment of Norwegian political prisoners, foreign Prisoners of War (POWs) (in particular Red Army soldiers and Yugoslav prisoners) and, in some periods, Jews from central Norway. More than 4200 people from at least 16 different countries went through Falstad, many of whom were deported to other camps in Norway and Germany. Around 200 inmates were executed in the nearby Falstad Forest. \r\nDuring the Nazi occupation, the prisoners of Falstad were forced to perform labour in a local quarry. Some of the prisoners had previously been sent to other parts of the country to work on large infrastructural projects. These include the Atlantic Wall fortifications or the accompanying Norwegian “blood roads”. In total, 100,000 Soviet POWs and other forced labourers were sent to Norway to work under the command of the German Wehrmacht and Organization Todt (a Nazi civil and military engineering organisation responsible for a huge range of engineering projects in Nazi Germany and occupied territories, and the associated supply of forced labour). More than 15,000 POWs and forced labourers died on Norwegian territory.\r\nFalstad drew on an existing spatial infrastructure of exclusion. Based on a model of traditional prisons and houses of correction, the main building of the camp was erected in 1921 and was part of a state-run boarding school for delinquent boys. After the liberation of Norway, Falstad was handed over to the Ministry of Justice Department of High Treason and functioned as a forced labour camp for convicted Norwegian Nazi collaborators and sympathizers until 1949. Thereafter, the barracks, watchtowers and barbed wire were removed and the main building was reused as a boarding school for “troubled” boys once again. \r\nIn 1995, the Norwegian-Yugoslavian Friendship Association mounted a small exhibition about the wartime history of Falstad concentration camp. The Falstad Center Foundation was established in 2000, leading to the opening of a memorial museum and human rights educational facility in 2006. In 2009, the Norwegian governmental-organisation War Grave Service and the Falstad Memorial and Human Rights Centre launched a project War Graves Seek Names that sought to uncover the identity of the unknown Soviet POWs buried in Norway. Since then, the Centre has drafted plans for visitors and school children to commemorate victims of terror, reconceptualise and experience the current pastoral Falstad landscape as a former site of power, exclusion and xenophobia (including with the aid of archaeology and digital visualisations), and benefit from the site’s mission to consider collective memory as a transformative agent for strengthening human rights by means of research, remembrance and education. Today, the memorial is part of a larger network of state-funded Norwegian memorials that frame past wars and political violence as turning points in ethical and active liberal citizenship. \r\n","files":[]},"linkedPages":[]}]},"linkedPages":[]},{"id":2320,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2320","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-11-20T18:29:22+00:00","modified":"2019-11-25T15:42:57+00:00","item_type":"icon","collection":null,"owner":{"id":29,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/29","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2320","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2320","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Pedestal for a cross located in the central square of Castuera concentration camp","creator":["Laura Muñoz-Encinar"],"description":"A large square dedicated to public events and re-education activities such as prayers, mass or the singing of the Francoist Hymn was created between the two main blocks of barracks of Castuera concentration camp.
