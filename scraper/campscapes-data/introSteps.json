The project aims at conducting an extensive investigation of the dynamics of collective memory on Holocaust camp sites and post-war communist similar sites of repression and their afterlives.</p>","<p>The history of these spaces is often fragmented. We look at disputes and conflicts over remembrance, but also at the epistemology of these sites as heritage, in short competing memories, rather than heroic pasts.</p>"]
