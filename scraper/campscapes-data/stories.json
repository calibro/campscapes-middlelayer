case of competing memories, between the history of the European Holocaust and the pre-war refugee crisis, is evidently a reaction to the harsh tone of the contemporary times and the current European refugee crisis. However, it speaks more broadly about how the history of the rise of authoritarianism in Europe in the 1930s has been quietly erased from this history of camps and sites of political violence in Europe. Indeed, little of the precarious position of European Jewish refugees in 1938 in the Netherlands was of interest during the debate , although the neglect of this history has been an enduring staple of the discussions about accountability in the Netherlands in the last decades. It has subsided, however, exactly at a time when issues of responsibility would be relevant for the wider political and public sphere. In contrast to other camps, Westerbork was originally built as a Centraal-Jewish Refugee camp funded by the community, and because of the Nazi-German occupation changed in 1942 from a refugee camp for Jews into a transit camp.

The camp was built after the refugee policy changed dramatically in Europe in 1938. After a first wave of migration of some 38,000 Jews to neighbouring countries, mostly political opponents escaping Nazi-Germany after Hitler’s 1933 rise to power, The exclusion of Jews from German public life, as proclaimed in the 1920 Programme of the Nazi Party, achieved by the Nuremberg race laws and Germany’s support of Jewish emigration, meant that lmost 30 per cent of the Jewish population had left the country still without the threat of genocide. The March 1938 Anschluss of Austria and the following Austrian-Jewish migration wave aggravated the conditions. All very well received in Berlin, they created an example soon to be followed by the German Reichskristallnacht, or November Pogrom. This was a nation-wide Nazi organised ‘popular fury’ against everything Jewish, mainly shops, synagogues and cemeteries, which - carefully organised by Gestapo and the SD. While Jews were robbed of their properties, 400 were killed, 30,000 sent to concentration camps, and another 113,000 (of a total of 523,000) German Jews fled to other countries during the next two years, despite the British and American immigration restrictions.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1851,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1851","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:13:09+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:13:09+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1851","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":134,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/134","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Arrests of refugees 1938","startDate":"1938-01-13","provenance":"Het Volksdagblad","files":[{"id":554,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/554","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/8840035a3b684410f1d1a8638ed51da3.jpg","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-08-09T07:13:11+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:13:11+00:00","filename":"8840035a3b684410f1d1a8638ed51da3.jpg","authentication":"7bfa2262c509ee8f7a4f43036e76f406","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"1938-13-01 Het Volksdagblad - antifascistisch e vluchteling.jpg","size":159164,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":0,"item":{"id":1851,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1851","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":6,"exhibitId":29,"exhibitSlug":"the-erasure-of-refugees-in-wes","exhibitTitle":"The erasure of refugees in Westerbork"}]},"file":{"id":554,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/554","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/8840035a3b684410f1d1a8638ed51da3.jpg","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-08-09T07:13:11+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:13:11+00:00","filename":"8840035a3b684410f1d1a8638ed51da3.jpg","authentication":"7bfa2262c509ee8f7a4f43036e76f406","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"1938-13-01 Het Volksdagblad - antifascistisch e vluchteling.jpg","size":159164,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":0,"item":{"id":1851,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1851","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}}]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":135,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/135","title":"paragraph7","slug":"paragraph7","order":7,"exhibit":{"id":29,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/29"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":334,"page_id":135,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>In his first election speech in Köningsberg of 27 March 1938, directly after the Austrian Anschluss, Hitler responded to the American Secretary of State Cordell Hull’s call for an international committee for refugees with a promise to “our newly united German Volk and Reich” of a total cleansing of the “incorrigible foes” [Jews], and for which he counted on full popular support by means of a referendum. Not having found any international opposition after the Anschluss and Kristallnacht, he now cynically approved the Hull plan: “I can only hope and expect that the other world, which has such deep sympathy for these criminals, will at least be generous enough to convert this sympathy into practical aid. We, on our part, are ready to put all these criminals at the disposal of these countries for all I care, even on luxury ships.”(Hitler is pleased to get rid of foes. Commenting on Hull's Plan He Says Some Opponents of Nazis Deserve to Die”, The New York Times, March 27, 1938).As Goebbels reported in his diary, if “nobody wants the scum!” there should be another way to remove them. In this way, as Ronnie Landau put it, the Evian conference triggered the change of the Nazi policy towards the ‘Final Solution’. (Landau (2006)).</p>\n<p>The Netherlands was only fleetingly involved in efforts to temper this wave of refugees. When 32 countries assembled on president Roosevelt’s initiative in Evian (15), It was on hindsight the last opportunity to save the lives of Europe’s Jews, but the stalemate of the Evian conference only confirmed the complete lack of collective international opposition against the racial politics of Nazi Germany. The United States and Great Britain, facing Hitler’s policy of mass migration, refused to change their restricted immigration policy for ‘undesirable immigrants’, and appealed to Germany’s (soon occupied) neighbouring countries to act as the refugee’s main host countries (like the Netherlands). Eastern European countries, some of them already collaborating with Nazi Germany, refused to take part. The Anglo-Saxon dominated Evian Committee closed their meetings in October 1938 with a memorandum to the German Foreign Office, confirming that none of the assembled nations challenged the right of the German government to deal with its subjects as it liked, as no-one questioned its state sovereignty. (Evian Memorandum, October 1938, quoted in Ronnie S. Landau (2006).) This actually sent the unmistakable permission to all neighbours to close their borders. Chancellor Hitler could also presented himself to the world as a truly democratic leader.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1924,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1924","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:16:57+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:16:57+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1924","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":135,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/135","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Evian","copyright":"Memorial Centre Camp Westerbork.","files":[{"id":619,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/619","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/f166f4a09d9ded096ea9ce74d83801a3.jpg","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-08-09T07:17:00+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:17:00+00:00","filename":"f166f4a09d9ded096ea9ce74d83801a3.jpg","authentication":"cd87ad5e37834af3ba69925d5f98f750","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Evian.jpg","size":1156612,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.02","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2048,"resolution_y":2704,"compression_ratio":0.069619323610084}},"item":{"id":1924,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1924","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":7,"exhibitId":29,"exhibitSlug":"the-erasure-of-refugees-in-wes","exhibitTitle":"The erasure of refugees in Westerbork"}]},"file":{"id":619,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/619","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/f166f4a09d9ded096ea9ce74d83801a3.jpg","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-08-09T07:17:00+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:17:00+00:00","filename":"f166f4a09d9ded096ea9ce74d83801a3.jpg","authentication":"cd87ad5e37834af3ba69925d5f98f750","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Evian.jpg","size":1156612,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.02","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2048,"resolution_y":2704,"compression_ratio":0.069619323610084}},"item":{"id":1924,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1924","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}}]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":136,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/136","title":"paragraph8","slug":"paragraph8","order":8,"exhibit":{"id":29,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/29"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":335,"page_id":136,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>The current debates around the internment in Westerbork show how the usage and the relevance of “illegality” have been conditioned and catalyzed in the late 1930s by the threat of war.

The borders were accessible and individuals could stay without a work permit, in the sense that they were not illegal even if their permits had expired. In the 19th century, the primary concern was with the poor and working class, who could become troublesome citizens. Towards 1890, the direct target of this policy were mainly small groups of Hungarian Roma, which for a first time were named “Zigeuners”; this in contrast to the older Sinti nomads with Western-European passports, who were generally allowed to travel. The legislation was tightened only after the First World War, when foreign soldiers and no less than 2 million Belgium refugees entered the country of which many were housed, for a first time, in temporary refugee camps. Travelling without passports would become more difficult in Europe after the democratic success of the introduction of universal suffrage in 1918-19. With the German and Russian revolutions, there was fear for communist agitators to stay in the Netherlands. It strengthened the nationalism of governments now having to take care of citizens wanting to protect their national welfare against the “competition” of others. The 1930s economic crisis further strengthened the wish for protectionism against the competition from foreign German-Jewish businessmen for instance.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The possibilities of a Jewish refugee arriving from Germany to the Netherlands after 1933 were  gradually limited. As approximately 40,000 individuals crossed the border from Germany between 1933 and 1940 (more than a quarter of the total number of German-Jewish refugees) they were primarily seen as “economic migrants''. After May 1934, work permits were limited only for jobs which could not be performed by a Dutch citizen, and official policies restricted the possibility of long term accommodation. Permitted to stay were however still refugees who could sustain themselves financially.  Despite the prominence of many members of the Jewish community who had migrated from Eastern Europe because of a growing anti-Semitism, after Hitler’s rise to power in 1933 and his policy of mass migration after Kristallnacht, Dutch newspapers ran articles concluding “refugees are not welcome”</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It had fostered the rise of the fascist NSB party who in Hitler’s footsteps succeeded in criminalising refugees and creating fears of disturbing the economic and social balance.

In an effort of the government to activate workers who because of the economic depression lost their jobs, a system of labour camps was developed. Illegal refugees were then no longer allowed to work in regular jobs. They were, however, offered comparable reclamation and agricultural work in a new, almost military organised, fenced refugee camps such as Heijplaat in Rotterdam. In addition, small groups of German Jewish refugees found work in a number of Zionist kibbutzim and hakhshara (agricultural) training centres as to prepare themselves for emigration to Palestine. When the war broke out, Zionist pioneer camps like the Deventer Association (1918) and, in particular, the modern agricultural school complex Werkdorp Wieringermeer (1934) each had some three hundred workers occupied.Wieringermeer under its last Jewish director Abel Herzberg was evacuated in 1941 by the Amsterdam SD. Most refugees were sent to the new Amsterdam ghetto, from where with the second razzia (raid) on 11 June the majority of Werkdorp Jews were deported first to Camp Schoorl and from there, just like the victims of the first Amsterdam raid of 22-23 February (which would lead to the February Strike), to Mauthausen (Austria) where most of them died within a few months after arrival.</p>\n<p>When the first occupants of Westerbork arrived, it brought a temporary respite in an otherwise precarious existence. Aanti-refugee sentiments were often stirred up on a local level by right-wing neighbours who did not like the idea of having foreigners in their countryside.</p>\n<p>From the beginning of the German occupation also Dutch Jews were treated on paper already as potential refugees. This proved to become practice after the beginning of the deportations in February 1941, when there was little distinction being made anymore between Jewish residents and “stateless” German-Jewish refugees. Both groups were from then on treated in the same way as internees of the same transit camp waiting to be deported to the eastern labour-, concentration or extermination camps, sometimes the one treated more brutal, or offered more privileges than the other.</p>\n<p>Jews were needed, on the one hand, for forced labour in the war industry, whereas on the other, war introduced more easy and violent ways to exclude the millions of Polish and Russian Jews in the newly occupied Eastern territories. It was to these regions that from mid 1942 also many Westerbork Jews were deported.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1906,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1906","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:16:06+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:16:06+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1906","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":139,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/139","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Those

It was established in 1939, after the Dutch borders were closed down for refugees by the government, as a central refugee camp for Jews who fled from Germany and Anschluss Austria. In total, after Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933, almost 32,000 German Jews found refuge in the Netherlands, some 10,000 after the 1938 November or Kristallnacht pogroms. At the beginning of the German occupation in May 1940 it hosted only 750 refugees, but when the Nazis turned the refugee camp into a transit camp in July 1942 the camp was enlarged with new barracks for Dutch Jews. Already since February 1941 Dutch and German Jews were caught by Nazi raids (razzia’s) in the Amsterdam Judenviertel and in other cities, but from July 1942 until the beginning of the railway strike of September 1944 the Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager Westerbork served that function. In close cooperation with the Amsterdam Jewish Council (Joodse Raad) at about 107,000 (of a total of 145,000 Dutch Jews), and 245 Sinti and Roma, of 97 transports were selected for weekly deportations to concentration and extermination camps in Germany and Eastern Europe, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau and Sobibor. The façade of a seemingly peaceful place where people waited in fear on the deadly transports was described in painful details by the Dutch journalist Philip Mechanicus in his camp diary In Depot and in the letters and diaries of Etty Hillesum, and filmed by the German-Jewish photographer Rudolf Breslauer for his 1944 Westerbork film, of which the footage (since 2017 registered as UNESCO Memory of the World) contains the only known real-life moving images of a Nazi train transport. Only 5,000 deportees survived the war. After Poland, the Germans were nowhere more successful in the extermination of Jews than in the Netherlands.  Yet the camp was controlled by only a few German SS officers, with help of some SS trained volunteers from German and Amsterdam police battalions and the Dutch Waffen SS, housed in the nearby SS camp Hooghalen, or Heidelager. The Dutch military police (Marechaussee) continued to guard the camp inside, assisted by a Jewish camp police. The latter, the OD (Ordnungsdienst), distinctive in their green overalls (since 1943) who had to help with the transports, garnered the worst reputation among Dutch Jewish inmates as the ‘Jewish SS’.  Westerbork underwent a new transformation after the liberation, when between 1945 and 1948 it came to serve as an internment camp for members of the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB), SS volunteers and other people suspected of having collaborated with the Nazis. It also briefly served as a training base for soldiers during the Indonesian War of Independence  (1945-1949) and a camp for Dutch repatriates from the Dutch Indies. From 1951 to 1970 the camp, renamed Schattenberg, became the residence of a large part of former Moluccan soldiers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army  (KNIL) with their families, who left the island of Ambon after the Indonesian repression of their independence movement. Two decades after living in the camp, the Moluccans saw their camp demolished after the government approved the project of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on the campscape. The Schattenberg community was relocated to surrounding villages. With the exception of the camp commander’s house and the 1949 Resistance Monument, the campscape was already half empty when in 1970 the National Monument Camp Westerbork was unveiled, and in 1983, three kilometres away from the silence zone, the Memorial Centre  Camp Westerbork was opened. From then on Jewish survivors held regular commemorations and the annual number of visitors rose constantly, reaching 180,000 in 2019. Since 2000 the Memorial Center has made room for research and presentations on the wider biography of the site, but confronted itself in 2008 with strong protests against its temporary exhibition of the NSB period, after which the museum and the “holy ground” of the campscape have become separated spaces, the latter mainly dedicated to Holocaust commemoration. Yet, within the current context of a growing competition of Holocaust and postcolonial memories, and the refugee issue, the memorialization of the various groups which went through Westerbork and Schattenberg, and their divergent experiences including the role of the perpetrators, remains contested up to today.

The debate was only part of the competing memories and disputations around the memory of colonialism, in which the Westerbork site has played a substantial part. The veterans of the KNIL, Moluccans from the southern islands of Indonesia, fought next to the Dutch colonial authorities until the end of the Indonesian Independence War. Part Dutch and loyal to the Dutch Crown from which they were expecting support for an independent republic, they agreed to the temporary plan of being evacuated to the Netherlands. In 1951, approximately 13000 former KNIL soldiers and families arrived in the country and were housed on the premises of the former concentration camps.

KNIL in Schattenberg","description":"The footage is a rare occasion when Moluccan KNIL veterans participate in the official commemorations of the victims of the war in 1956. A joined ceremony contrasts with the situation nowadays, when the Westerbork memorial organises separate commemorations on the former campsite. The difference shows the politics and the simmering conflicts around the integration of the Moluccan community. At the same time, this dynamics testifies to the evident tensions around the status of former KNIL soldiers within the broader public memory of the heroism of the Dutch army during the war. It is a situation that escalated through time, as was the case of the longstanding opposition of the Dutch government against granting the Moluccan soldiers state veteran pensions.","startDate":"1988-01-01","copyright":"Memorial Centre Camp Westerbork","endDate":"1988-01-01","timelineLabel":"Showing the postcolonial history","files":[{"id":758,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/758","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/59872dfc070658e8e3cf4c07d6a3ff54.mp4","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-08-09T15:42:55+00:00","modified":"2019-10-30T09:37:19+00:00","filename":"59872dfc070658e8e3cf4c07d6a3ff54.mp4","authentication":"d372208fcea5c96efde070eaca74cfe3","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"video/mp4","order":null,"original_filename":"Stille4mei1956molukkers.mp4","size":21582009,"stored":true,"type_os":"ISO Media, MPEG v4 system, version 1","metadata":{"mime_type":"video/quicktime","audio":{"dataformat":"mp4","codec":"ISO/IEC 14496-3 AAC","sample_rate":44100,"channels":2,"bits_per_sample":16,"lossless":false,"channelmode":"stereo","streams":[{"dataformat":"mp4","codec":"ISO/IEC 14496-3 AAC","sample_rate":44100,"channels":2,"bits_per_sample":16,"lossless":false,"channelmode":"stereo"}]},"video":{"dataformat":"quicktime","resolution_x":1280,"resolution_y":720,"fourcc":"avc1","frame_rate":30},"comments":{"language":["Undetermined"],"encoding_tool":["Lavf58.19.102"]},"comments_html":{"language":["Undetermined"],"encoding_tool":["Lavf58.19.102"]}},"item":{"id":2164,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2164","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":1,"exhibitId":30,"exhibitSlug":"the-knil-veterans-and----natio","exhibitTitle":"The KNIL Veterans and “national” heritage"},{"paragraph":4,"exhibitId":30,"exhibitSlug":"the-knil-veterans-and----natio","exhibitTitle":"The KNIL Veterans and “national” heritage"}]},"file":{"id":758,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/758","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/59872dfc070658e8e3cf4c07d6a3ff54.mp4","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-08-09T15:42:55+00:00","modified":"2019-10-30T09:37:19+00:00","filename":"59872dfc070658e8e3cf4c07d6a3ff54.mp4","authentication":"d372208fcea5c96efde070eaca74cfe3","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"video/mp4","order":null,"original_filename":"Stille4mei1956molukkers.mp4","size":21582009,"stored":true,"type_os":"ISO Media, MPEG v4 system, version 1","metadata":{"mime_type":"video/quicktime","audio":{"dataformat":"mp4","codec":"ISO/IEC 14496-3 AAC","sample_rate":44100,"channels":2,"bits_per_sample":16,"lossless":false,"channelmode":"stereo","streams":[{"dataformat":"mp4","codec":"ISO/IEC 14496-3 AAC","sample_rate":44100,"channels":2,"bits_per_sample":16,"lossless":false,"channelmode":"stereo"}]},"video":{"dataformat":"quicktime","resolution_x":1280,"resolution_y":720,"fourcc":"avc1","frame_rate":30},"comments":{"language":["Undetermined"],"encoding_tool":["Lavf58.19.102"]},"comments_html":{"language":["Undetermined"],"encoding_tool":["Lavf58.19.102"]}},"item":{"id":2164,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2164","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}}]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":144,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/144","title":"paragraph2","slug":"paragraph2","order":2,"exhibit":{"id":30,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/30"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":343,"page_id":144,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Their stay in the camp was contradictory.

in the camp show how families were trying to maintain a semblance of normality for children who were growing up far from the homeland. Some integrated fast and went to work in the surrounding cities, like Assen. The camp was a temporary home where children learned the language, and adults were passing the time before hopefully returning to the islands. Initially isolated in the camp in Drenthe, some tried to find work in agriculture or private houses around the camp in order to supplement the little financial support offered by the government. The Dutch government also organized a school in Schattenberg, where children could learn the proper language. Some, with time, went to schools around the former camp.  At the same time, the arrival of the Moluccans in 1951 hightlighted how authority was built on differentiations between identities, based on nationality, religion, ethnicity, class, and gender. by exclusion and inclusion between various, newly performed categories of in- and outsiders, of established and newcomers, and of privileged and disenfranchised, are then part of the biography of this campscape, as similar to many others. From former subjects of the Dutch empire, they were evidently considered rather “second class” citizens, if citizens at

It was established in 1939, after the Dutch borders were closed down for refugees by the government, as a central refugee camp for Jews who fled from Germany and Anschluss Austria. In total, after Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933, almost 32,000 German Jews found refuge in the Netherlands, some 10,000 after the 1938 November or Kristallnacht pogroms. At the beginning of the German occupation in May 1940 it hosted only 750 refugees, but when the Nazis turned the refugee camp into a transit camp in July 1942 the camp was enlarged with new barracks for Dutch Jews. Already since February 1941 Dutch and German Jews were caught by Nazi raids (razzia’s) in the Amsterdam Judenviertel and in other cities, but from July 1942 until the beginning of the railway strike of September 1944 the Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager Westerbork served that function. In close cooperation with the Amsterdam Jewish Council (Joodse Raad) at about 107,000 (of a total of 145,000 Dutch Jews), and 245 Sinti and Roma, of 97 transports were selected for weekly deportations to concentration and extermination camps in Germany and Eastern Europe, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau and Sobibor. The façade of a seemingly peaceful place where people waited in fear on the deadly transports was described in painful details by the Dutch journalist Philip Mechanicus in his camp diary In Depot and in the letters and diaries of Etty Hillesum, and filmed by the German-Jewish photographer Rudolf Breslauer for his 1944 Westerbork film, of which the footage (since 2017 registered as UNESCO Memory of the World) contains the only known real-life moving images of a Nazi train transport. Only 5,000 deportees survived the war. After Poland, the Germans were nowhere more successful in the extermination of Jews than in the Netherlands.  Yet the camp was controlled by only a few German SS officers, with help of some SS trained volunteers from German and Amsterdam police battalions and the Dutch Waffen SS, housed in the nearby SS camp Hooghalen, or Heidelager. The Dutch military police (Marechaussee) continued to guard the camp inside, assisted by a Jewish camp police. The latter, the OD (Ordnungsdienst), distinctive in their green overalls (since 1943) who had to help with the transports, garnered the worst reputation among Dutch Jewish inmates as the ‘Jewish SS’.  Westerbork underwent a new transformation after the liberation, when between 1945 and 1948 it came to serve as an internment camp for members of the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB), SS volunteers and other people suspected of having collaborated with the Nazis. It also briefly served as a training base for soldiers during the Indonesian War of Independence  (1945-1949) and a camp for Dutch repatriates from the Dutch Indies. From 1951 to 1970 the camp, renamed Schattenberg, became the residence of a large part of former Moluccan soldiers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army  (KNIL) with their families, who left the island of Ambon after the Indonesian repression of their independence movement. Two decades after living in the camp, the Moluccans saw their camp demolished after the government approved the project of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on the campscape. The Schattenberg community was relocated to surrounding villages. With the exception of the camp commander’s house and the 1949 Resistance Monument, the campscape was already half empty when in 1970 the National Monument Camp Westerbork was unveiled, and in 1983, three kilometres away from the silence zone, the Memorial Centre  Camp Westerbork was opened. From then on Jewish survivors held regular commemorations and the annual number of visitors rose constantly, reaching 180,000 in 2019. Since 2000 the Memorial Center has made room for research and presentations on the wider biography of the site, but confronted itself in 2008 with strong protests against its temporary exhibition of the NSB period, after which the museum and the “holy ground” of the campscape have become separated spaces, the latter mainly dedicated to Holocaust commemoration. Yet, within the current context of a growing competition of Holocaust and postcolonial memories, and the refugee issue, the memorialization of the various groups which went through Westerbork and Schattenberg, and their divergent experiences including the role of the perpetrators, remains contested up to today.

It was the fourth such type of action demanding the the support of the government for the independent republic of Moluccan Islands. It turned however into a divisive political debate and memorial concern when two of the hostages were killed. The intervention of the Dutch troops resulted in the death of six of the hijackers. The debate in the recent trial was whether the intervention en force had indeed been necessary and whether the victims were not an unncessary consequence of the use of force. It was a tense moment, which was also amply speculated by the fact that Parliamentary elections were being held at the time. The prime-minister was among the first on site and the intervention was covered live. Images around that intervention resonated for many with pictures taking during evacuation of the Moluccan communities from the “temporary” accommodations, like Westerbork.

Men were discharged from the army upon, or just before, arrival and not, as they felt entitled to, in accordance with the military charter of the KNIL in their own Moluccas. This caused<br />a sharp conflict between the Moluccans and the Dutch government. Attempts to fight the discharge in court failed for procedural reasons. Deep mistrust and resentment resulted among the Moluccans.</p>\n<p>On the other hand,  the decolonisation, which refers to<br />Indonesia (1949) and Surinam (1975) changed a landscape which, right after the war, in 1947, only counted about 104,000 individuals with a foreign nationality, that is 1 % of the population. Following Indonesia,  large numbers of Eurasian repatriates who had been interned in the Japanese camps in the Dutch East Indies/ Indonesia during the War returned home. Migration from Indonesia has caused no economic problems for migrants with Dutch citizenship (which they possessed in case of two Dutch parents, and could choose in case of one Dutch parent) and apparently, integration has been smooth. But the position of Moluccans,  concentrated in certain areas in the Netherlands, isolated and seen to be deliberately declining integration, hoping to return to an independent Moluccan republic, caused difficulties. Up until the mid-1970s<br />they were convinced that they would return to a re-established RMS.<br />Reluctantly integrating into Dutch society caused tensions on both sides.</p>\n<p>The train hijacking of 1977 has been since considered a trauma, of both an seeming “excessive” way of making political claims and perhaps a too unsensitive position of the Dutch government concerning the long, rather than short process of integrating and coming to terms with its own “postcolonial” condition. Integration was not a failed project for most, but by the 1970s, many of the Moluccan community had returned to Indonesia. Despite the political dissonances and differences of opinion concerning the political position of the community in the Netherlands, however, the hijackings were equally prompted by ambigous positions against those in the country, like for instance in West Capelle. That forceful intervention of the government came at a time when issues of rights of this temporary group who was nevertheless an integral part of the Dutch larger society and of debates about the path of social democracy in front wider changes coming from opening borders and massive immigration to the Netherlands. </p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1908,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1908","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:16:12+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:16:12+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1908","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":3,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=1908","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Capelle and unpaid duty","description":"Article about the repressive actions of the Dutch state in West Capelle in 1956 where the Moluccans stages a protest against their neglect and exclusion from Dutch society.

Integration in Dutch society had a direct relation to the mass emigration post-war. The heroic memory of the military overshadowed the past colonial history. </p>\n<p>The relative isolation of Moluccans continued until the mid-1960s, even though the Dutch government curtailed their living allowances after 1956, forcing them to look for jobs. In 1956, for example, central services in the camps were stopped. In the 1960s, most of the camps were broken up and their residents were housed in special quarters within villages and small towns. While still living in one of the 60 camps (the number changed over time), a whole range of associations and institutions was established, varying from churches and sports clubs to societies based on villages or islands of origin known as kumpulan. Each camp had a council representing the interests of its inhabitants vis-à-vis the Dutch government and its representatives. These Moluccan institutions were local, but were presided over by national boards. There were conflicts and schisms among the organisations and churches. Supporters of rivalling ones were housed in different camps. The result was that in 1953, the Moluccan camps (which were spread all over the country) formed a kind of Moluccan archipelago. Some of the camps were linked to each other by interest organisations and churches, but almost all were linked by the kumpulan, which were not influenced by politics. </p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2063,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2063","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:25:06+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:25:06+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2063","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":3,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2063","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Zwarte

Within a few years of their arrival, however, an increasing number of Moluccans found work on the labour market. For that reason, the Dutch government curtailed its subsistence allowances. Moluccan leaders sharply reproached the Dutch government for neglecting its true responsibility to them as exiles. Meanwhile, they exerted tight<br />social control over their rank and file, to ensure that the RMS ideal was upheld.</p>\n<p> As the situation changed in Indonesia in the 1960s, the RMS movement in the Netherlands transformed from a nationalistic support movement into an ex-patria nationalistic movement: Moluccans in the Netherlands were convinced that they had to liberate the Moluccas working from the outside. Consequently, the second generation found its inspiration in movements such as the Black Panthers in the United States and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, as well as in Castro’s Cuba. Inspired by the spirit of the 1960s and the civil rights movement, the Moluccan youngsters turned to radical political responses.  Inspired by the ‘black is beautiful’ movement, they took a provocative attitude towards Dutch society, travelling around the country in large groups. This quite often resulted in fights and confrontations with local youths.<br />Some Moluccan youngsters became involved in criminal activities, robbing<br />banks or selling drugs to raise money for ‘the struggle’, as it was called. From the<br />mid-1960s onwards, young Moluccan activists from all over the Netherlands met and entered into discussions, overcoming the many political divides among existing Moluccan organisations. Young Moluccans started to study Dutch colonial history, the<br />role and position of the Moluccan Islands and particularly of Moluccans in that history. They immersed themselves in the history of social and political movements and with classic works in the field, such as those by Franz Fanon and Karl Marx. </p>\n<p>It is partly why the verdict in 2018 has been amply contested, just as much as the reaction in 1977 was contested by a great deal of public opinion. Many considered it a justified political cause left unaddressed for too long by the government. There were shows of solidarity with the protesters across Europe. Official reactions from the government showed however outrage, a sense of betrayal for what had been a temporary solutions meant to also protect the former KNIL soldiers from the new Indonesian authorities who would have held them accountable for what essentially would have been considered a “collaboration” with the colonial authorities. In the aftermath of the intervention, newspapers were discussing the problematic position on past colonialism and an unreflexive look at the past as the underlying debate of the situation.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1901,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1901","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:15:54+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:15:54+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1901","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":153,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/153","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"A

For a long time, unemployment was not seen as a problem by Moluccans because they were not meant to become a part of Dutch society. However, in the course of the 1970s, unemployment became a serious problem. Dutch social work institutions seemed incapable of helping Moluccans. From 1976 on, this led to an increasing number of Moluccan initiatives to deal with the problems within their community. Like the political discussion on reformulating the RMS ideal and the visits to the Moluccas, the ‘discovery’ of social problems resulted in a minimised emphasis on the RMS. Many people who were politically active in earlier years could be found in the emerging Moluccan social work initiatives. Some of them combined their activities in social work projects (such as drug aid) with organising political courses, but they were no longer rigidly oriented towards the RMS ideal. A large group of young Moluccans entered academic programmes for social work, called ‘second-chance education’ for people who had dropped out of school.</p>\n<p>The hijackings was another defining moment in the relationship between Moluccan immigrants and Dutch society at large. This was an agreement between the Moluccans and the Dutch government made in 1986. Its prelude was a growing dissatisfaction about the condition of housing in specific Moluccan quarters, most of which were built<br />hastily by the Dutch government or housing cooperatives in the 1960s and<br />was in bad shape by the 1980s. During the tense 1970s, some housing cooperations and the Dutch government had not raised house rents in Moluccan wards. In the 1980s, they nevertheless decided to bring rents up to par with the normal level in the Netherlands, though without improving the housing’s poor quality. Inhabitants often refused to pay rent. Efforts to evict these tenants in January 1984 led to battles and<br />police had to draw guns. Again, tensions between Moluccans and Dutch authorities increased and once more, the issue became political. Moluccan spokesmen pointed out that the Dutch government had brought Moluccan soldiers to the Netherlands and therefore were responsible for providing proper housing. They explicitly used the term ‘KNIL-rechten’ (‘the rights of KNIL soldiers’).  The housing dispute coincided with a major change in Dutch government policy towards ethnic minorities. From the 1950s onwards, this policy was focused on establishing specific ethnic-based facilities under the so-called ‘group-oriented approach’.  When, however, in the 1970s the Netherlands became an immigration country and other groups came to the country (such as Moroccans), the government wanted to abandon the group-oriented approach. It was too expensive and considered an obstruction to integration. </p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2141,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2141","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T08:39:26+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T08:39:26+00:00","item_type":"reference","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2141","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":154,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/154","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Emerging

It was established in 1939, after the Dutch borders were closed down for refugees by the government, as a central refugee camp for Jews who fled from Germany and Anschluss Austria. In total, after Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933, almost 32,000 German Jews found refuge in the Netherlands, some 10,000 after the 1938 November or Kristallnacht pogroms. At the beginning of the German occupation in May 1940 it hosted only 750 refugees, but when the Nazis turned the refugee camp into a transit camp in July 1942 the camp was enlarged with new barracks for Dutch Jews. Already since February 1941 Dutch and German Jews were caught by Nazi raids (razzia’s) in the Amsterdam Judenviertel and in other cities, but from July 1942 until the beginning of the railway strike of September 1944 the Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager Westerbork served that function. In close cooperation with the Amsterdam Jewish Council (Joodse Raad) at about 107,000 (of a total of 145,000 Dutch Jews), and 245 Sinti and Roma, of 97 transports were selected for weekly deportations to concentration and extermination camps in Germany and Eastern Europe, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau and Sobibor. The façade of a seemingly peaceful place where people waited in fear on the deadly transports was described in painful details by the Dutch journalist Philip Mechanicus in his camp diary In Depot and in the letters and diaries of Etty Hillesum, and filmed by the German-Jewish photographer Rudolf Breslauer for his 1944 Westerbork film, of which the footage (since 2017 registered as UNESCO Memory of the World) contains the only known real-life moving images of a Nazi train transport. Only 5,000 deportees survived the war. After Poland, the Germans were nowhere more successful in the extermination of Jews than in the Netherlands.  Yet the camp was controlled by only a few German SS officers, with help of some SS trained volunteers from German and Amsterdam police battalions and the Dutch Waffen SS, housed in the nearby SS camp Hooghalen, or Heidelager. The Dutch military police (Marechaussee) continued to guard the camp inside, assisted by a Jewish camp police. The latter, the OD (Ordnungsdienst), distinctive in their green overalls (since 1943) who had to help with the transports, garnered the worst reputation among Dutch Jewish inmates as the ‘Jewish SS’.  Westerbork underwent a new transformation after the liberation, when between 1945 and 1948 it came to serve as an internment camp for members of the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB), SS volunteers and other people suspected of having collaborated with the Nazis. It also briefly served as a training base for soldiers during the Indonesian War of Independence  (1945-1949) and a camp for Dutch repatriates from the Dutch Indies. From 1951 to 1970 the camp, renamed Schattenberg, became the residence of a large part of former Moluccan soldiers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army  (KNIL) with their families, who left the island of Ambon after the Indonesian repression of their independence movement. Two decades after living in the camp, the Moluccans saw their camp demolished after the government approved the project of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on the campscape. The Schattenberg community was relocated to surrounding villages. With the exception of the camp commander’s house and the 1949 Resistance Monument, the campscape was already half empty when in 1970 the National Monument Camp Westerbork was unveiled, and in 1983, three kilometres away from the silence zone, the Memorial Centre  Camp Westerbork was opened. From then on Jewish survivors held regular commemorations and the annual number of visitors rose constantly, reaching 180,000 in 2019. Since 2000 the Memorial Center has made room for research and presentations on the wider biography of the site, but confronted itself in 2008 with strong protests against its temporary exhibition of the NSB period, after which the museum and the “holy ground” of the campscape have become separated spaces, the latter mainly dedicated to Holocaust commemoration. Yet, within the current context of a growing competition of Holocaust and postcolonial memories, and the refugee issue, the memorialization of the various groups which went through Westerbork and Schattenberg, and their divergent experiences including the role of the perpetrators, remains contested up to today.

The memorial argued, however, that these were designed as memorials, whereas the house is one of the few remaining authentic remnants of the disappeared camp. It was developed from the start as an integral part of the 1939 plan of the Central Refugee Camp. After the camp turned into a transit camp for Dutch Jews in 1942, the director’s home became the seat of the Nazi-German camp commander Albert Gemmeker and his secretary and mistress Elisabeth Hassler. They both played an important role in the many transmitted memories of inmates, whose experience and fate in (and after) the camp were decided from this perpetrator space. Slanted to the main road of the camp, which in 1942 turned into a railway platform, the commander had a panoptic view on the railway platform.

It sits under a glass case, as a particularly precious exhibit. All camp commanders after 1941 inhabited the house, including the name indelibly linked to the Westerbork camp, Albert Konrad Gemmeker. After the war, the house was linked to the colonial history of the Netherlands, through col. Van der Speck O’Breen, a former officer in the Dutch Army in Indonesia who, as the new territorial commander, was assigned duties concerning the temporary habitation of the Moluccan group. Initially built by day wagers, many of them Jewish refugees, working to survive in Drenthe, the house is historically significant for the rights, exclusion and perception of refugees in the Netherlands and how the regime of detention for protection gradually turned into a space of concentration and the Holocaust. A symbol of power for most living in the nearby camp, before, during and after the war, it was a vehicle of a spatial organisation of power and hierarchy by means of demarcations. All through the existence of any form of camp, it spoke about a process of denationalization or statelessness for refugees, inmates and the temporary inhabitants of Schattenberg. It was inevitably a space of power for the various individuals who lived in the camp. Inmates in the camp would refer to it as the “outside”. These connotations reinforced the oppositions which make a camp: between “citizens” and “strangers”, “natives” and “migrants”, “residents” and “occupiers”. The story of the former “Commander’s” house tells us a lot about the physical existence designated who was an inmate and who held authority and how. What are the implications of memorialization when the most visible element on the site is the “the heritage” of power and the

for more than sixty years after the end of the war, the former commander house had an independent biography from the camp. Its last inhabitant was the daughter of the late territorial commander of the Northern Netherlands, Colonel Piet van der Speck Obreen, who took residency with his wife and two daughters in 1950, when Westerbork functioned shortly as a military training site. Recently returned from the Dutch Indies, which soon before had become independent after three years of violent decolonization wars, the colonel was posted in the house next to the camp which was then renamed Schattenberg. The former Jewish refugee and transit camp had already been reused to function as a temporary housing for the Moluccan veterans with their families of the KNIL. Although in no formal relation to Schattenberg, his military past and his present position made him partly responsible for the life of the Moluccan community far from Indonesia. He retired as a commandable example of authority in the area.</p>\n<p>But the Camp Westerbork memorial center has recently received its European heritage label because of its functioning as a memorial site of the Second World War. Westerbork is not only relevant to the Dutch Jewish community, but the location symbolizes a collective memory among Jewish survivor communities all over the world. Furthermore, as a \"European heritage site\" is brings forward a transnational symbolism of the Holocaust as a history which should be prevented from repeating, embodied by the phrase \"never again\".  </p>\n<p>The symbolism of Westerbork as a space of educational remembrance is particularly linked with that of perpetratorship also by different heritages. The Westerbork film, for instance,  commissioned by Albert Gemmeker, the commander of the camp, remains a singular testimony of the life inside a concentration camp, where one sees also the absurd facade of an efficient, functional life in imprisonment which made transports seem to be naturally blended in the background.   Even though the (probably) unfinished film was meant for propaganda, the 90 minutes footage offers today the only contemporary visual testimony of a Holocaust campscape. Filmed by an experienced Jewish filmmaker the also still existing script offered enough space to go beyond the staged appearance of the few other, comparable propaganda movies, such as Kurt Gerron’s Theresiënstadt.</p>\n<p></p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2039,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2039","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:23:40+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:23:40+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2039","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":157,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/157","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Speck

has been an ample historical attention on the perpetrators in the Netherlands. this inchoate debate, there have been attempts to discuss and understand for instance the role and the motivation of Albert Konrad Gemmeker, the last commander of Westerbork . Described as a “gentleman”, his character was probed extensively after the war, more so than his deeds. The trial after the war and the short sentence were however an accurate map of the debates on what a memory of perpetratorship should serve: reconstruction, localizing the perpetrator and moving on, rather than dwelling on the past. Identifying the perpetrator as “German” was a side of the debate, fuelling in fact much of the selectivity of the history ever since. Their histories are infinitely more complex. For instance, the first commander of Westerbork, Erich Deppner, working in the Sicherheitspolizei in the Hague, has all chances of being held accountable after the war as evidence against him was mounting. The direct adjuct of Hanns Albin Rauter, in Camp Amersfoort, Deppner was responsble for mass shootings and murders of hundreds of Russian and German war prisoners. Testimonies from Westerbork speak about a ruthless person who coordinated the first transports. For his “achievements” he was transferred as commander in Kamp Vught, also in the Netherlands,where he was responsble, again, for at least 500 executions and a ruthless regime of the facility. Towards the end of the war, Deppner was transferred again to Germany and despite the waves of trials immediately after the war and a new momentum of transitional justice which swept Germany at the end of the 1950s and beginning of the 1960s, Deppner never appeared in a court of law. In 1964, the German authorities re-opened the case against AK Gemmeker, who suggests in an interview at the time that he is no way to be held responsible, and the he did not know what the transports and the destinations of these were. Despite the large uproar also in the Netherlands, he was sentenced to only two years of prison. Deppner, who by that time had ascended from the ranks of the Organization Gehlen to the German BND (the West German Secret Service) was never even questioned.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1930,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1930","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:17:19+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:17:19+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1930","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":2,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=1930","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Dining

Westerbork camp in the Netherlands testifies to overlapping histories of politics of exclusion and inclusion. It was established in 1939, after the Dutch borders were closed down for refugees by the government, as a central refugee camp for Jews who fled from Germany and Anschluss Austria. In total, after Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933, almost 32,000 German Jews found refuge in the Netherlands, some 10,000 after the 1938 November or Kristallnacht pogroms. At the beginning of the German occupation in May 1940 it hosted only 750 refugees, but when the Nazis turned the refugee camp into a transit camp in July 1942 the camp was enlarged with new barracks for Dutch Jews. Already since February 1941 Dutch and German Jews were caught by Nazi raids (razzia’s) in the Amsterdam Judenviertel and in other cities, but from July 1942 until the beginning of the railway strike of September 1944 the Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager Westerbork served that function. In close cooperation with the Amsterdam Jewish Council (Joodse Raad) at about 107,000 (of a total of 145,000 Dutch Jews), and 245 Sinti and Roma, of 97 transports were selected for weekly deportations to concentration and extermination camps in Germany and Eastern Europe, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau and Sobibor. The façade of a seemingly peaceful place where people waited in fear on the deadly transports was described in painful details by the Dutch journalist Philip Mechanicus in his camp diary In Depot and in the letters and diaries of Etty Hillesum, and filmed by the German-Jewish photographer Rudolf Breslauer for his 1944 Westerbork film, of which the footage (since 2017 registered as UNESCO Memory of the World) contains the only known real-life moving images of a Nazi train transport. Only 5,000 deportees survived the war. After Poland, the Germans were nowhere more successful in the extermination of Jews than in the Netherlands.  Yet the camp was controlled by only a few German SS officers, with help of some SS trained volunteers from German and Amsterdam police battalions and the Dutch Waffen SS, housed in the nearby SS camp Hooghalen, or Heidelager. The Dutch military police (Marechaussee) continued to guard the camp inside, assisted by a Jewish camp police. The latter, the OD (Ordnungsdienst), distinctive in their green overalls (since 1943) who had to help with the transports, garnered the worst reputation among Dutch Jewish inmates as the ‘Jewish SS’.  Westerbork underwent a new transformation after the liberation, when between 1945 and 1948 it came to serve as an internment camp for members of the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB), SS volunteers and other people suspected of having collaborated with the Nazis. It also briefly served as a training base for soldiers during the Indonesian War of Independence  (1945-1949) and a camp for Dutch repatriates from the Dutch Indies. From 1951 to 1970 the camp, renamed Schattenberg, became the residence of a large part of former Moluccan soldiers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army  (KNIL) with their families, who left the island of Ambon after the Indonesian repression of their independence movement. Two decades after living in the camp, the Moluccans saw their camp demolished after the government approved the project of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on the campscape. The Schattenberg community was relocated to surrounding villages. With the exception of the camp commander’s house and the 1949 Resistance Monument, the campscape was already half empty when in 1970 the National Monument Camp Westerbork was unveiled, and in 1983, three kilometres away from the silence zone, the Memorial Centre  Camp Westerbork was opened. From then on Jewish survivors held regular commemorations and the annual number of visitors rose constantly, reaching 180,000 in 2019. Since 2000 the Memorial Center has made room for research and presentations on the wider biography of the site, but confronted itself in 2008 with strong protests against its temporary exhibition of the NSB period, after which the museum and the “holy ground” of the campscape have become separated spaces, the latter mainly dedicated to Holocaust commemoration. Yet, within the current context of a growing competition of Holocaust and postcolonial memories, and the refugee issue, the memorialization of the various groups which went through Westerbork and Schattenberg, and their divergent experiences including the role of the perpetrators, remains contested up to today.

It was established in 1939, after the Dutch borders were closed down for refugees by the government, as a central refugee camp for Jews who fled from Germany and Anschluss Austria. In total, after Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933, almost 32,000 German Jews found refuge in the Netherlands, some 10,000 after the 1938 November or Kristallnacht pogroms. At the beginning of the German occupation in May 1940 it hosted only 750 refugees, but when the Nazis turned the refugee camp into a transit camp in July 1942 the camp was enlarged with new barracks for Dutch Jews. Already since February 1941 Dutch and German Jews were caught by Nazi raids (razzia’s) in the Amsterdam Judenviertel and in other cities, but from July 1942 until the beginning of the railway strike of September 1944 the Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager Westerbork served that function. In close cooperation with the Amsterdam Jewish Council (Joodse Raad) at about 107,000 (of a total of 145,000 Dutch Jews), and 245 Sinti and Roma, of 97 transports were selected for weekly deportations to concentration and extermination camps in Germany and Eastern Europe, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau and Sobibor. The façade of a seemingly peaceful place where people waited in fear on the deadly transports was described in painful details by the Dutch journalist Philip Mechanicus in his camp diary In Depot and in the letters and diaries of Etty Hillesum, and filmed by the German-Jewish photographer Rudolf Breslauer for his 1944 Westerbork film, of which the footage (since 2017 registered as UNESCO Memory of the World) contains the only known real-life moving images of a Nazi train transport. Only 5,000 deportees survived the war. After Poland, the Germans were nowhere more successful in the extermination of Jews than in the Netherlands.  Yet the camp was controlled by only a few German SS officers, with help of some SS trained volunteers from German and Amsterdam police battalions and the Dutch Waffen SS, housed in the nearby SS camp Hooghalen, or Heidelager. The Dutch military police (Marechaussee) continued to guard the camp inside, assisted by a Jewish camp police. The latter, the OD (Ordnungsdienst), distinctive in their green overalls (since 1943) who had to help with the transports, garnered the worst reputation among Dutch Jewish inmates as the ‘Jewish SS’.  Westerbork underwent a new transformation after the liberation, when between 1945 and 1948 it came to serve as an internment camp for members of the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB), SS volunteers and other people suspected of having collaborated with the Nazis. It also briefly served as a training base for soldiers during the Indonesian War of Independence  (1945-1949) and a camp for Dutch repatriates from the Dutch Indies. From 1951 to 1970 the camp, renamed Schattenberg, became the residence of a large part of former Moluccan soldiers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army  (KNIL) with their families, who left the island of Ambon after the Indonesian repression of their independence movement. Two decades after living in the camp, the Moluccans saw their camp demolished after the government approved the project of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on the campscape. The Schattenberg community was relocated to surrounding villages. With the exception of the camp commander’s house and the 1949 Resistance Monument, the campscape was already half empty when in 1970 the National Monument Camp Westerbork was unveiled, and in 1983, three kilometres away from the silence zone, the Memorial Centre  Camp Westerbork was opened. From then on Jewish survivors held regular commemorations and the annual number of visitors rose constantly, reaching 180,000 in 2019. Since 2000 the Memorial Center has made room for research and presentations on the wider biography of the site, but confronted itself in 2008 with strong protests against its temporary exhibition of the NSB period, after which the museum and the “holy ground” of the campscape have become separated spaces, the latter mainly dedicated to Holocaust commemoration. Yet, within the current context of a growing competition of Holocaust and postcolonial memories, and the refugee issue, the memorialization of the various groups which went through Westerbork and Schattenberg, and their divergent experiences including the role of the perpetrators, remains contested up to today.

F. Weinreb), by D. Giltay Veth and A.J. van der Leeuw, 1976","timelineLabel":"De-constructing heroism","description":"In 1973, the RIOD issued a report on the collaboration of Friederich Weinreb, a man of Jewish origin who had been both hailed for his brave actions during the war to save Jews and accused of de facto collaboration, The quest for moral grounds concerning collaborationa and resistance was not however a historigraphical debate. It is telling that RIOD, an institution which had concentrated the documentation on “occupation” of the Netherlands, to centre stage in the  political dispute between the left and the right in Dutch politics at the time. The case brought against Weinreb shows both a deep reconsideration of memory politics across time, the way the image of the resistance was embroiled with contemporary politics and the specific change in the way witnesses and the Holocaust became gradually a matter of social widespread guilt and regret, rather than individual trajectories and suffering.  Indeed, when Friedrich Weinreb decided to publish his memoirs in 1969, Collaboratie en verzet 1940-1945, he did so with the close collaboration of Renate Rubinstein and Aad Nuis, two journalists on the left side of the political spectrum. The war and resistance were a heroic narrative equally resonant to those who asked for more radical expressions in Dutch politics as a whole. Rubinstein’s weekly columns in Vrij Nederland, which started to appear in 1962 were a pertinent social commentary, widely read at the time.  In 1969, the fact that an influential journalist on the left was willing to support of a member of the Jewish community who had been previously been accused of collaboration is of significance in itself. The 1960s were a time of intense contestations in Dutch politics, with massive street movements directed against the government (provos) and where state establishment was being heavily questioned. The role of resistance, opposition, leftism and Jewish resistance were crucial in these debates about the political spectrum. Like in Germany, the memory of the war was central to the political debate, as many were contesting the credentials and the credibility of key indivisuals in administration and political parties. Their actions during the war were being scrutinized less for an interest in the conflict, but more so to establish a form of “moral highground”. These actions and the debate were symptomatic for a changing memory politics around the Second World War which was growingly turning to the global Holocaust remembrace discourse. In a Dutch history dominated by heroic images of resistance, there were many episodes which became candidates to be integrated in this memory canon but there was an increasing sensitivity to the narratives set in place immediately after the war. There was an interest, one might argue, in a functional history, one that could mediate of sorts the political sphere. The publication changed and influenced a particular type of the image of the collaboration.  With passages such as N/A, the impression was one of a man who reacted to circumstances, rather than care for strong political statements. Almost none of the opponents of Weinreb, whether they were Germans or Jews, were actually endowed with any privilege that might have been of interest to him. Consequently, yhe image he constructed was rather that of a disobedient rebel, also prone to tricking a highly organized SS in the Netherlands, a rather \"bourgeois disobedience of the rebel,\" of the man who stood alone in his struggle against the bureaucracy, which he often outwitted. Weireb’s selfstyled resistance and what is evidently a work of disculpation by placing blame on circumstances, government and others resonated with the deep fractures between left and right which were

and foremost, it suggested to what extent “resistance” was a “usable” past after the war. It was a struggle of public and wide debate, shaped by historiography but reaching far into the public sphere. Immediately after the war, accounts circulated but were often coloured by the relief of the end of the war. The difficulties encountered in publishing the diary of Anne Frank in the first years after the war are illustrative of this. These changes also coincided with different voices, sometimes more critical on the war politics, which emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, in comparison to the prior decade, for instance, Etty Hillesum. The memory conflict and debate about resistance and opposition was shaped by the two foremost visible historians of the time, Leo de Jong and Jacques Presser, who had different opinions on the matter. In the 1960s, Loe de Jong dealt with the persecution of Jews in his television series The Occupation, a widely popular show and an important memory device of the age. Interestingly, a case like Weinreb, who had been prosecuted in 1948 for his contribution to the deportation but served virtually no time in prison due to the amnesty for Queen Wilhemina’s jubileum, was a far too controversial case to feature at all in the series. Jacques Presser, on the other hand, dedicated consistent passages to his character in the canonical book <em>Ondergang: De vervolging en verdelging van het Nederlandse Jodendom 1940-1945</em> primarily because of the side of the type of history he portrayed, that of compromise, rather than opposition. He was a side of a deeply contested and debated length and seriousness of the Jewish resistance and complicity. Interestingly, as the image of the resistance was being shaped either by the underground non-Jewish resistance or soldiers in the Dutch army, there were far more visible “moral” doubts about Jewish institutions.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2133,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2133","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T08:39:22+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T08:39:22+00:00","item_type":"reference","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2133","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":174,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/174","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Voorzitter van de Joodse Raad.

Hillesum, of Jewish origin worked, initially for the Jewish Council in the camp and had an opportunity to escape. She decided, however, to stay next to her family in the camp and also document the regime inside, interactions and personal despair as the fate of those insides were becoming more apparent with time. Hillesum wrote evocative accounts from it to her friends, later published as in the early 1950s as “Letters from Westerbork”. Her diary, however, a depiction of the thought and political assessment of the Netherlands before the war of an unorthodox young woman of Jewish origin in Amsterdam was a more problematic text. Her musings over complicity, responsibility and ethics challenged the perception of the victim of the Holocaust. Like Philip Mechanicus, Hillesum is, in fact, one of the rare voices of witnesses who did not survive the Shoah but left behind a critical testimony of the context and the compromises which led to mass murder. The book poses interesting questions about the type of voice telling the story of camp, not as a survivor, but as a victim who never had the opportunity to reconsider opinions at the height of the social polarisation.","startDate":"1970-01-01","endDate":"1970-01-02","year":"1970","latitude":52.917784,"longitude":6.6093611,"provenance":"The Westerbork Memorial","files":[{"id":744,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/744","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T08:20:44+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:05:43+00:00","filename":"7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","authentication":"6bac9cd75a0398655cde20858451d8c3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"WBK_icon 5_Etty Hillesum diary_1970.jpg","size":63448,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":514,"resolution_y":840,"compression_ratio":0.048984003458712}},"item":{"id":2102,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2102","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":2,"exhibitId":34,"exhibitSlug":"dynamics-of-the-jewish-memory-","exhibitTitle":"Dynamics of the Jewish memory of resistance around Westerbork"},{"paragraph":6,"exhibitId":40,"exhibitSlug":"documenting-camps","exhibitTitle":"Documenting camps"},{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":44,"exhibitSlug":"intro--do-not-remove-","exhibitTitle":"intro [DO NOT REMOVE]"}]},"file":{"id":744,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/744","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T08:20:44+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:05:43+00:00","filename":"7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","authentication":"6bac9cd75a0398655cde20858451d8c3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"WBK_icon 5_Etty Hillesum diary_1970.jpg","size":63448,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":514,"resolution_y":840,"compression_ratio":0.048984003458712}},"item":{"id":2102,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2102","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}}]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":175,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/175","title":"paragraph3","slug":"paragraph3","order":3,"exhibit":{"id":34,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/34"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":374,"page_id":175,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>In 1946–1948, Dutch Jews established the only semipermanent honor court (Joodse Ereraad) in Western Europe, an organization which was meant to investigate the morality of actions of members of the community, otherwise widespread in Eastern Europe.

But in 1943, both Asscher and Cohen were interned in the camp from where they were deported to Theresienstadt which they survived, but did not limit the suspicion concerning their actions during the war. The trial effectively terminated any official functions they might hold in the Jewish community. In 1956, the memoires of David Cohen, leader of the Jewish Council brought to the fore controversial questions about the organization. Weinreb was a similar disputed case, and was tried in 1948 but freed after 6 months. His case, in particular, contributed in a deeply divisive debate about the Jewish “resistance” which started with the case around the directors of the Jewish Council early after the war. Pardoned, however, his story in fact provided an alternative narrative to the other trials. It equally emerged in a context focused almost exclusively on an affirmative memory. Indeed, the context of collaborators was more complicated after the war. Notes from survivors of Westerbork for instance suggests a reluctance of the authorities in engaging with mass-scale actions against collaborators. Many of these were evident among survivors of Westerbork, like Werner Sterzenbach, who were trying to make sense of the responsibility and responses post-war.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2069,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2069","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:25:12+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T15:58:11+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2069","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":2,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2069","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Complaint asking to start the juridical investigation ","description":"Two individuals are named to be suspected of collaboration; postwar","year":"1949","copyright":"Memorial Centre Camp Westerbork.","files":[{"id":762,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/762","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/9f40ad9b1a5efa2db0a4fff54ddec63f.pdf","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-08-09T15:58:10+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T15:58:11+00:00","filename":"9f40ad9b1a5efa2db0a4fff54ddec63f.pdf","authentication":"aafdd4ae44f483b1c3208c3701171ce7","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"application/pdf","order":null,"original_filename":"complaint collaborators.pdf","size":2174566,"stored":true,"type_os":"PDF document, version 1.6","metadata":{"mime_type":"application/pdf"},"item":{"id":2069,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2069","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":8,"exhibitId":33,"exhibitSlug":"the-trace-of-the-political-lef","exhibitTitle":"The trace of the political Left"},{"paragraph":4,"exhibitId":34,"exhibitSlug":"dynamics-of-the-jewish-memory-","exhibitTitle":"Dynamics of the Jewish memory of resistance around Westerbork"}]},"file":{"id":762,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/762","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/9f40ad9b1a5efa2db0a4fff54ddec63f.pdf","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-08-09T15:58:10+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T15:58:11+00:00","filename":"9f40ad9b1a5efa2db0a4fff54ddec63f.pdf","authentication":"aafdd4ae44f483b1c3208c3701171ce7","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"application/pdf","order":null,"original_filename":"complaint collaborators.pdf","size":2174566,"stored":true,"type_os":"PDF document, version 1.6","metadata":{"mime_type":"application/pdf"},"item":{"id":2069,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2069","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}}]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":177,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/177","title":"paragraph5","slug":"paragraph5","order":5,"exhibit":{"id":34,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/34"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":376,"page_id":177,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>Much of the debates at the time issues focused on how exactly one can describe resistance. There were individuals actions that many took, from helping people in hiding, distributing illegal newspapers or blowing up railway lines. So were the propaganda leaflets which insisted on larger actions. Publishing manifestos and newspapers for awareness was the activity which made resistance neworks come together .The type of resistance that prevailed differed per phase of the occupation and was closely re lated to the German measures and the course of the war. There was a sporadic mobilization of former members of the military but their influence was limited. The communist resistance was less developed as in neighbouring countries, primarily due to a rather weak presence on the political local spectrum.</p>\n<p>In 1940, the small Communist party went into hiding, where Paul de Groot, the leader, initiated the publication of de Waarheid (the Truth). By 1941, there was a strong network of support which initiated the Februaristaking (walks out in Amsterdam and Zaandam) of workers protesting against the treatment of the Jewish community. Landelijke Organisatie (LO) was set up with the direct purpose of hiding those to be deported. For the fake papers, documents there was a continous “annoyance” of German authorities but the actions were considered to be kept under control by the SS. Binnenlandse Strijdkrachten , the local traces of the army decided often against guerilla actions. It was in this contrast that the memory of the resistance emerged after the war as a crucial binding force. Its character was predominanly military and . Westerbork is a good example of this, as the first monument on site was a esistance monument opened at Westerbork on 4th of May 1949 a r, next to the crematory, the place were all of the resistance fighters and escaped prisoners were shot. This monument officially commemorated only those shot elswhere in 1943 in Drenthe brought to Westerbork and cremated there. A small number of resistance fighters were shot at Westerbork and 4 escaped prisoners were shot (one still alive was put to death by a doctor

It was the case of Bep Turksma, a young Jewish woman who managed to escape from Westerbork in 1942, who had been on one of the lists of Weinreb and who he argued had reported him to the SD, presumably affecting the chances of his plans. Turksma initiated a legal case against the publication of Collaboration and Resistance and filed two criminal complaints against Weinreb, Rubinstein for defamation. Although the RIOD report would establish a decade later that her claims were true, the judge at the time decided that she could not prove her claims. The verdict occassioned further campaigning in Vrij Nederland against Turksma.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the passages about her were erased in the edition of 1971 of his bioraphy. It is significant in this sense that a case started in 1969, was weakened by 1979. This story of inside the Weinreb affaire suggests a remarkable shift in just one decade concerning the survivors of the war and of Westerbork itself. From their silencing in face of a canonical memory which seemed to insist on the heroic memory of those who tried to do something, an almost utilitarian view on the resistance, to the 1971 moment, when the National Monument for the Holocaust, designed by Ralf Prins had been just installed on the site.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1902,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1902","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:15:56+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:15:56+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1902","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":179,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/179","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Autobiography bep Turksma","description":"Turksma, the witness in the Weinreb trial, wrote her autobiography about her activities in the resistance and after; a survivor involved in the post-war state institutions","year":"1970","files":[{"id":600,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/600","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/6cc1fabe89cd32dbaeca9f63ab5674f7.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/6cc1fabe89cd32dbaeca9f63ab5674f7.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/6cc1fabe89cd32dbaeca9f63ab5674f7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/6cc1fabe89cd32dbaeca9f63ab5674f7.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T07:15:57+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:03:49+00:00","filename":"6cc1fabe89cd32dbaeca9f63ab5674f7.jpg","authentication":"0fecf986faee7b19826289cd12b0fab4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"bep turksma.jpg","size":15712,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":200,"resolution_y":268,"compression_ratio":0.09771144278607}},"item":{"id":1902,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1902","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":7,"exhibitId":34,"exhibitSlug":"dynamics-of-the-jewish-memory-","exhibitTitle":"Dynamics of the Jewish memory of resistance around Westerbork"}]},"file":{"id":600,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/600","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/6cc1fabe89cd32dbaeca9f63ab5674f7.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/6cc1fabe89cd32dbaeca9f63ab5674f7.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/6cc1fabe89cd32dbaeca9f63ab5674f7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/6cc1fabe89cd32dbaeca9f63ab5674f7.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T07:15:57+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:03:49+00:00","filename":"6cc1fabe89cd32dbaeca9f63ab5674f7.jpg","authentication":"0fecf986faee7b19826289cd12b0fab4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"bep turksma.jpg","size":15712,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":200,"resolution_y":268,"compression_ratio":0.09771144278607}},"item":{"id":1902,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1902","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}},{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1916,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1916","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:16:37+00:00","modified":"2019-08-12T18:11:16+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1916","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":179,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/179","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"The 102,000 stones","description":"The monuments on site on Westerbork have been controversial ever since.

fact, although the debate itself questioned the grounds of many memorial images and history perspectives, it is telling that as the debate about the publication came to question the guilt possibly attributed to Weinreb, there were many more voices not often questioned the verdict in the trial of Weinreb, which had been one of the most followed at the time. Fred Polak asked Minister of Justice Ivo Samkalden on 25 May 1965 whether this was not seen in Presser's study as a reason to revise the judgment. Samkalden answered in the negative: Presser might have a different opinion on the criminal case against Weinreb, but he had not provided any new information. A few legal scholars shared Samkalden's sobering judgment: Presser's argument was emotional and made no sense legally; Weinreb was correctly sentenced in 1948. The historian M.C. Brands, a student and employee of Presser, wrote in the Volkskrant of 23 May 1969: 'What is missing or forgotten in this work is difficult to determine. According to a connoisseur like Presser, this is little. I therefore cannot imagine that this valuable document does not give our Minister of Justice any reason to take steps.

Westerbork camp in the Netherlands testifies to overlapping histories of politics of exclusion and inclusion. It was established in 1939, after the Dutch borders were closed down for refugees by the government, as a central refugee camp for Jews who fled from Germany and Anschluss Austria. In total, after Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933, almost 32,000 German Jews found refuge in the Netherlands, some 10,000 after the 1938 November or Kristallnacht pogroms. At the beginning of the German occupation in May 1940 it hosted only 750 refugees, but when the Nazis turned the refugee camp into a transit camp in July 1942 the camp was enlarged with new barracks for Dutch Jews. Already since February 1941 Dutch and German Jews were caught by Nazi raids (razzia’s) in the Amsterdam Judenviertel and in other cities, but from July 1942 until the beginning of the railway strike of September 1944 the Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager Westerbork served that function. In close cooperation with the Amsterdam Jewish Council (Joodse Raad) at about 107,000 (of a total of 145,000 Dutch Jews), and 245 Sinti and Roma, of 97 transports were selected for weekly deportations to concentration and extermination camps in Germany and Eastern Europe, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau and Sobibor. The façade of a seemingly peaceful place where people waited in fear on the deadly transports was described in painful details by the Dutch journalist Philip Mechanicus in his camp diary In Depot and in the letters and diaries of Etty Hillesum, and filmed by the German-Jewish photographer Rudolf Breslauer for his 1944 Westerbork film, of which the footage (since 2017 registered as UNESCO Memory of the World) contains the only known real-life moving images of a Nazi train transport. Only 5,000 deportees survived the war. After Poland, the Germans were nowhere more successful in the extermination of Jews than in the Netherlands.  Yet the camp was controlled by only a few German SS officers, with help of some SS trained volunteers from German and Amsterdam police battalions and the Dutch Waffen SS, housed in the nearby SS camp Hooghalen, or Heidelager. The Dutch military police (Marechaussee) continued to guard the camp inside, assisted by a Jewish camp police. The latter, the OD (Ordnungsdienst), distinctive in their green overalls (since 1943) who had to help with the transports, garnered the worst reputation among Dutch Jewish inmates as the ‘Jewish SS’.  Westerbork underwent a new transformation after the liberation, when between 1945 and 1948 it came to serve as an internment camp for members of the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB), SS volunteers and other people suspected of having collaborated with the Nazis. It also briefly served as a training base for soldiers during the Indonesian War of Independence  (1945-1949) and a camp for Dutch repatriates from the Dutch Indies. From 1951 to 1970 the camp, renamed Schattenberg, became the residence of a large part of former Moluccan soldiers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army  (KNIL) with their families, who left the island of Ambon after the Indonesian repression of their independence movement. Two decades after living in the camp, the Moluccans saw their camp demolished after the government approved the project of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on the campscape. The Schattenberg community was relocated to surrounding villages. With the exception of the camp commander’s house and the 1949 Resistance Monument, the campscape was already half empty when in 1970 the National Monument Camp Westerbork was unveiled, and in 1983, three kilometres away from the silence zone, the Memorial Centre  Camp Westerbork was opened. From then on Jewish survivors held regular commemorations and the annual number of visitors rose constantly, reaching 180,000 in 2019. Since 2000 the Memorial Center has made room for research and presentations on the wider biography of the site, but confronted itself in 2008 with strong protests against its temporary exhibition of the NSB period, after which the museum and the “holy ground” of the campscape have become separated spaces, the latter mainly dedicated to Holocaust commemoration. Yet, within the current context of a growing competition of Holocaust and postcolonial memories, and the refugee issue, the memorialization of the various groups which went through Westerbork and Schattenberg, and their divergent experiences including the role of the perpetrators, remains contested up to today.

This divided commemoration triggered the anger of the Secretary of the German Jewish Central Council Stephan Kramer, who warned against the political use, misuse and divisions in which the Holocaust was just a pawn. The real danger of a rise of anti-Semitism was not located in Palestine but in Germany itself, in the growing exclusion of its Turkish minority whose ‘foreign’ mosques were treated almost the same as the 1400 Jewish synagogues destroyed in the November Pogrom once, and which could make them prey for Muslim extremism. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">(iv)   </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The equation between the Holocaust and debates about contemporary rights entangle visibly on sites of heritage, like Westerbork, which have been used repeatedly and continue to stand as memorial debate.

The government required Jews to identify themselves in ways that would permanently separate them from the rest of the German population. In an August 1938 law, authorities decreed that by January 1, 1939, Jewish men and women bearing first names of “non-Jewish” origin had to add “Israel” and “Sara,” respectively, to their given names.

It was established in 1939, after the Dutch borders were closed down for refugees by the government, as a central refugee camp for Jews who fled from Germany and Anschluss Austria. In total, after Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933, almost 32,000 German Jews found refuge in the Netherlands, some 10,000 after the 1938 November or Kristallnacht pogroms. At the beginning of the German occupation in May 1940 it hosted only 750 refugees, but when the Nazis turned the refugee camp into a transit camp in July 1942 the camp was enlarged with new barracks for Dutch Jews. Already since February 1941 Dutch and German Jews were caught by Nazi raids (razzia’s) in the Amsterdam Judenviertel and in other cities, but from July 1942 until the beginning of the railway strike of September 1944 the Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager Westerbork served that function. In close cooperation with the Amsterdam Jewish Council (Joodse Raad) at about 107,000 (of a total of 145,000 Dutch Jews), and 245 Sinti and Roma, of 97 transports were selected for weekly deportations to concentration and extermination camps in Germany and Eastern Europe, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau and Sobibor. The façade of a seemingly peaceful place where people waited in fear on the deadly transports was described in painful details by the Dutch journalist Philip Mechanicus in his camp diary In Depot and in the letters and diaries of Etty Hillesum, and filmed by the German-Jewish photographer Rudolf Breslauer for his 1944 Westerbork film, of which the footage (since 2017 registered as UNESCO Memory of the World) contains the only known real-life moving images of a Nazi train transport. Only 5,000 deportees survived the war. After Poland, the Germans were nowhere more successful in the extermination of Jews than in the Netherlands.  Yet the camp was controlled by only a few German SS officers, with help of some SS trained volunteers from German and Amsterdam police battalions and the Dutch Waffen SS, housed in the nearby SS camp Hooghalen, or Heidelager. The Dutch military police (Marechaussee) continued to guard the camp inside, assisted by a Jewish camp police. The latter, the OD (Ordnungsdienst), distinctive in their green overalls (since 1943) who had to help with the transports, garnered the worst reputation among Dutch Jewish inmates as the ‘Jewish SS’.  Westerbork underwent a new transformation after the liberation, when between 1945 and 1948 it came to serve as an internment camp for members of the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB), SS volunteers and other people suspected of having collaborated with the Nazis. It also briefly served as a training base for soldiers during the Indonesian War of Independence  (1945-1949) and a camp for Dutch repatriates from the Dutch Indies. From 1951 to 1970 the camp, renamed Schattenberg, became the residence of a large part of former Moluccan soldiers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army  (KNIL) with their families, who left the island of Ambon after the Indonesian repression of their independence movement. Two decades after living in the camp, the Moluccans saw their camp demolished after the government approved the project of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on the campscape. The Schattenberg community was relocated to surrounding villages. With the exception of the camp commander’s house and the 1949 Resistance Monument, the campscape was already half empty when in 1970 the National Monument Camp Westerbork was unveiled, and in 1983, three kilometres away from the silence zone, the Memorial Centre  Camp Westerbork was opened. From then on Jewish survivors held regular commemorations and the annual number of visitors rose constantly, reaching 180,000 in 2019. Since 2000 the Memorial Center has made room for research and presentations on the wider biography of the site, but confronted itself in 2008 with strong protests against its temporary exhibition of the NSB period, after which the museum and the “holy ground” of the campscape have become separated spaces, the latter mainly dedicated to Holocaust commemoration. Yet, within the current context of a growing competition of Holocaust and postcolonial memories, and the refugee issue, the memorialization of the various groups which went through Westerbork and Schattenberg, and their divergent experiences including the role of the perpetrators, remains contested up to today.

He reminded public opinion not of an individual story of survival, but of the uncomfortable and harrowing presence that images of war have been ever since. In April 1945, he fell under the photographic gaze of British photojournalist George Rodger, who was, as most at the time, looking to convey what seemed to be all of a sudden the hidden tragedies of the Nazi camp system. Maandag, an eight-year-old boy, was, in that famous picture, looking rather confused in the opposite direction of a road lined with corpses. For a long time, Maandag was almost synonymous to an image of innocence lost, of many generations having to deal and live with the reality of the war as the documentary evidence, those who had survived and were telling their stories and demanding people not to turn a blind eye were increasing. Roger’s very career testified to these issues: he set up Magnum, together with Robert Capa, another man shaped by war, and yet he refused to work in conflict zones, conflicted about the ethics of this documentation. Paradoxically, two years after Maandag’s death, in 2019, when the same picture was used in an exhibition in Amsterdam, it became evident that Maandag’s picture in Life magazine in 1945 had been indeed difficult for the American and worldwide public. The dead, arguably those who died because of the deadly typhus epidemics during the last days of the camp and in the first weeks after liberation, had been airbrushed. The debate focused on this selective truth of war which has been reproduced in the last seven decades, but it equally says something about the way images of war are used, disused and selectively become the symbol of conflict.</span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2180,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2180","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-09-19T12:57:00+00:00","modified":"2019-09-19T12:57:00+00:00","item_type":"hyperlink","collection":null,"owner":{"id":24,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/24","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2180","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":191,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/191","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"\"People should see the original photo of Sieg Maandag\"","url":"https://www.parool.nl/wereld/mensen-moeten-de-originele-foto-van-sieg-maandag-zien~b38d3200/","files":[]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":1,"exhibitId":40,"exhibitSlug":"documenting-camps","exhibitTitle":"Documenting camps"}]}}]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":192,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/192","title":"paragraph 2","slug":"paragraph-2","order":2,"exhibit":{"id":40,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/40"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":392,"page_id":192,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In the very least, the fact that a form of documentation, albeit the only such glimpse into a daily life of the camp, is turned into an object of heritage is an interesting issue. In 2017, the Westerbork movie, the only material filmed in the concentration camps, became UNESCO world heritage. It a sense, this change not only speaks about the awareness given to camps and to war in the age of “regret” but also that traces and representations of camps become, as Timothy Mitchell argues, images that do, and that they mobilize an understanding of history, a new way of finding direct relevance in this. Knowledge over the camps has been a dynamic process, over decades. The relevance of diaries and journals of prisoners or survivors has varied with the depth and the urgency of the remembrance of the war. Etty Hillesum, a critical Jewish voice on the political conditions and compromises which led to the persecutions of the Jewish community, wrote a diary in the camp which survived her. She perished in Auschwitz in 1943, and although her writings were well known for insiders, her diary reached public prominence only in the 1970s. Arguably, its renewed visibility depended on the growing place of the Holocaust in international debates of the 1970s in Western Europe and the United States. Although constantly revisited, for instance during the turning point of \"1968\", the opposition to the Vietnam War and debates about the Six Days War (1967), the issue of past atrocities reached a more coherent form towards the end of that decade. A different, but equally important shift occurred in the socialist bloc, where Jewish members of the Communist parties were purged, together with the reorientation away from the \"anti-fascist\" reading of the Second World War. </span></p>\n<p>The image of the camps was instrumental in the creation of the post-war humanitarian institutional framework as much as it defined the condition of the refugees in the context of the Cold War and the post-colonial dimension of international politics. The DP (displaced person) camps were a fixture of Europe post-war, with millions of people deciding or being forced to live in their former detention spaces because of uncertainties elsewhere. Many former inmates from Eastern Europe decided to stay behind in order to avoid the new socialist regimes in their countries of origins. As much as their presence was often a complex situation for British or Western governments who were the architects of the post-war humanitarian effort, the DP camps and their inhabitants also represented a powerful anti-Soviet image. Returning individuals to their home countries became a high stake and a divisive issue but went hand in hand with the visibility of the former camps post-war. With frequent protests of those in camps, for either support for relocation, or as in the case of Bergen Belsen, for arguing a political cause of a state, in this case Israel, the image of the camps, and their relevance for a type of public consciousness of solidarity is traceable in protests, public appeals of survivors, particularly children. </p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1962,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1962","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:18:59+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:18:59+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1962","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":192,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/192","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"On

Westerbork movie","timelineLabel":"Remembering perpetrators","description":"In the spring of 1944, Jewish deportee Rudolf Breslauer documented the everyday life in the Westerbork transit camp on film. The film was commissioned by the commander of the camp, Albert Gemmeker, who meant, most probably, to produce a professional record of the economic value of the facility. Breslauer documented the Tuesday train transports to other concentration camps, though most images picture ‘moments of normalcy’; healthy men and women working in workshops, playing sports, children at school, or scenes at the hospital, cabaret and even a church service. Next to stills showing the orderly camp, the productive daily labour and even football matches in the camp, the film follows trains and transports, the horror of anonymous faces, of all ages, some starving, some still unknowing as the trains depart. Breslauer never got to finalise the Westerbork film, but much of the raw footage is preserved, in different versions. Since 1948, fragments of the film are widely used in documentaries, films and newsreels and as evidence in the postwar trial against Gemmeker. Footage of the transports, especially the scene of the Dutch Sinti girl Settela Steinbach who looks at the lens behind the doors of a boxcar, became iconic for the systematic anonymization of the victims of the Nazis. The film remains the only filmed documentation of a concentration camp during the war. It was listed under UNESCO heritage in 2018, as a unique instance of heritage of perpetratorship.","year":"2018","latitude":52.9168056,"longitude":6.6065833,"provenance":"The Westerbork footage","startDate":"2018-01-01","endDate":"2018-01-01","files":[{"id":759,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/759","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/694db60bada2efe128529df1226f1aca.mp4","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-08-09T15:49:17+00:00","modified":"2019-10-30T09:31:16+00:00","filename":"694db60bada2efe128529df1226f1aca.mp4","authentication":"b1456643651e331b3cde76a836c77409","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"video/mp4","order":null,"original_filename":"hmwesterborkfilmtransport.mp4","size":10953961,"stored":true,"type_os":"ISO Media, MPEG v4 system, version 1","metadata":{"mime_type":"video/quicktime","audio":{"dataformat":"mp4","codec":"ISO/IEC 14496-3 AAC","sample_rate":44100,"channels":2,"bits_per_sample":16,"lossless":false,"channelmode":"stereo","streams":[{"dataformat":"mp4","codec":"ISO/IEC 14496-3 AAC","sample_rate":44100,"channels":2,"bits_per_sample":16,"lossless":false,"channelmode":"stereo"}]},"video":{"dataformat":"quicktime","resolution_x":640,"resolution_y":480,"fourcc":"avc1","frame_rate":25},"comments":{"language":["Undetermined"],"encoding_tool":["Lavf58.23.100"]},"comments_html":{"language":["Undetermined"],"encoding_tool":["Lavf58.23.100"]}},"item":{"id":2100,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2100","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":2,"exhibitId":40,"exhibitSlug":"documenting-camps","exhibitTitle":"Documenting camps"}]},"file":{"id":759,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/759","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/694db60bada2efe128529df1226f1aca.mp4","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-08-09T15:49:17+00:00","modified":"2019-10-30T09:31:16+00:00","filename":"694db60bada2efe128529df1226f1aca.mp4","authentication":"b1456643651e331b3cde76a836c77409","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"video/mp4","order":null,"original_filename":"hmwesterborkfilmtransport.mp4","size":10953961,"stored":true,"type_os":"ISO Media, MPEG v4 system, version 1","metadata":{"mime_type":"video/quicktime","audio":{"dataformat":"mp4","codec":"ISO/IEC 14496-3 AAC","sample_rate":44100,"channels":2,"bits_per_sample":16,"lossless":false,"channelmode":"stereo","streams":[{"dataformat":"mp4","codec":"ISO/IEC 14496-3 AAC","sample_rate":44100,"channels":2,"bits_per_sample":16,"lossless":false,"channelmode":"stereo"}]},"video":{"dataformat":"quicktime","resolution_x":640,"resolution_y":480,"fourcc":"avc1","frame_rate":25},"comments":{"language":["Undetermined"],"encoding_tool":["Lavf58.23.100"]},"comments_html":{"language":["Undetermined"],"encoding_tool":["Lavf58.23.100"]}},"item":{"id":2100,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2100","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}}]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":193,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/193","title":"paragraph 3","slug":"paragraph-3","order":3,"exhibit":{"id":40,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/40"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":393,"page_id":193,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Indeed, as heritage, the imagery of war and conflict have been central less to the remembrance of war and more so the precaution against war, a discourse of prevention which places imagery of war at the intersection of a didactic, social meaning of war.

Reports from the camp circulated through Europe all through the 5 years. The Polish Jan Karksi spoke about the inferno in occupied Poland as soon as 1940 as a matter of international affairs with the British, French and Soviet governments. The Vrba Wetzler report with testimonies smuggled out of Auschwitz kept headlines in 1943 all through Europe.

Images of these moments were perhaps as powerful as the images of bodies themselves. The \"victory\" against a barbaric regime was instrumental, for instance, in the political negotiations between Great Britain and the United States with Stalin's USSR.

style=\"font-weight:400;\">But the case of Roger’s retouching suggests however that images of atrocity have been difficult to debate even as the war was going on or ending. This debate, about the ethics of responsibility, whether this owes primarily to the dignity of the victim, or on the contrary, to the ethics of social knowledge about war and conflict in general continues today. Theorist Barbie Zelizer argues this type of representation is even in danger of representing these atrocities in a stereotypical manner which fundamentally come to erase their history and the genealogy, and consequently the conditions which might maintain their reference today. At the same time, despite the wealth of information on the violence being associated to the US and the United Kingdom, in particular, Western media was for instance cautious to report the violence, primarily because such information often emerged out of Soviet sources. The fact that the Soviet Army liberated concentrations camps affected the public responses and visibility of the phenomenon. Foreign correspondents were for instance invited to Majdanek, in Poland, for documentation, and they reacted partly with uncertainty about the source. Yet, Majdanek, or rather documentation of camps became a standard of bearing witness. It showed however the different perspectives on the matter: Soviet photography showed the ruin and destruction, gas chambers and crematoria without focusing on the victims. By the end of 1944, when American troops also began partaking in these acts of \"educational\" public witnessing, the focus moved towards the physical demise of victims.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span>The representation of camps was an important dimension of the Cold War. The International Commission Against the Concentration Camp Regime (CICRC) established in 1949 by the French intellectual and Nazi camp survivor David Rousset, in the wake of the Second World War, for instance, called upon fellow deportees who had been detained for their political activities to serve as expert witnesses to Nazism’s “concentrationary universe” and to oppose any repetition of its crimes in the postwar world.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The extent to which such images were to the displayed is a constant question for memorials and museums, for instance: does too much exposure desensitize the viewer?

Hillesum, of Jewish origin worked, initially for the Jewish Council in the camp and had an opportunity to escape. She decided, however, to stay next to her family in the camp and also document the regime inside, interactions and personal despair as the fate of those insides were becoming more apparent with time. Hillesum wrote evocative accounts from it to her friends, later published as in the early 1950s as “Letters from Westerbork”. Her diary, however, a depiction of the thought and political assessment of the Netherlands before the war of an unorthodox young woman of Jewish origin in Amsterdam was a more problematic text. Her musings over complicity, responsibility and ethics challenged the perception of the victim of the Holocaust. Like Philip Mechanicus, Hillesum is, in fact, one of the rare voices of witnesses who did not survive the Shoah but left behind a critical testimony of the context and the compromises which led to mass murder. The book poses interesting questions about the type of voice telling the story of camp, not as a survivor, but as a victim who never had the opportunity to reconsider opinions at the height of the social polarisation.","startDate":"1970-01-01","endDate":"1970-01-02","year":"1970","latitude":52.917784,"longitude":6.6093611,"provenance":"The Westerbork Memorial","files":[{"id":744,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/744","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T08:20:44+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:05:43+00:00","filename":"7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","authentication":"6bac9cd75a0398655cde20858451d8c3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"WBK_icon 5_Etty Hillesum diary_1970.jpg","size":63448,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":514,"resolution_y":840,"compression_ratio":0.048984003458712}},"item":{"id":2102,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2102","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":2,"exhibitId":34,"exhibitSlug":"dynamics-of-the-jewish-memory-","exhibitTitle":"Dynamics of the Jewish memory of resistance around Westerbork"},{"paragraph":6,"exhibitId":40,"exhibitSlug":"documenting-camps","exhibitTitle":"Documenting camps"},{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":44,"exhibitSlug":"intro--do-not-remove-","exhibitTitle":"intro [DO NOT REMOVE]"}]},"file":{"id":744,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/744","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T08:20:44+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:05:43+00:00","filename":"7d11cb102441828236d52b34c5cc5b66.jpg","authentication":"6bac9cd75a0398655cde20858451d8c3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"WBK_icon 5_Etty Hillesum diary_1970.jpg","size":63448,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":514,"resolution_y":840,"compression_ratio":0.048984003458712}},"item":{"id":2102,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2102","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}}]}],"extended_resources":[]}],"extended_resources":[],"camp":null,"tags":[],"creator":[]},{"id":41,"title":"The ambivalent memory of state involvement in Westerbork ","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/41","slug":"the-ambivalent-memory-of-state","description":"","credits":"","featured":false,"public":false,"added":"2019-09-20T14:45:20+00:00","modified":"2019-10-14T10:09:16+00:00","owner":{"id":24,"resource":"users","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/24"},"pages":[{"id":208,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/208","title":"paragraph 1","slug":"paragraph-1","order":1,"exhibit":{"id":41,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/41"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":409,"page_id":208,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In 2016, the NS (</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Nederlandse Spoorwegen), the Dutch Railway company agreed to pay several tens of millions of euros as compensations for the transports the company facilitated during the deportations from the Dutch concentration camps to the East.

In 2005, the company had already apologized for its actions during the war, consequently, in 2016, historian Job Cohen, who was in charge of the report leading up to the financial compensations was musing “ How could this have only happened so recently?” (1) in reference to the delay in the offering the compensation (2).

It has represented an intersection of processes of making the history public and accountability concerning the past from the institutions involved.  Compensations, for instance, have become more widespread in international politics and in memory dynamics because it is an attitude which longer stops at abstract apologies, but is about reparations and direct action for survivors or families of survivors. As </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Stiina Loytomaki argues “ criminal convictions end up individualizing guilt and responsibility whereas paying reparations is a way of assuming some notion of collective responsibility.</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> It is a way of holding perpetrators to moral standard and equally, a manner of showing another angle to the trespassing of the perpetrator has been resolved and accounted for.  In fact, apologies do not necessarily entail a more neutral and objective look at history. These have generated equal public posturing. Recently, the head of the PVV Geert Wilders was criticizing the “shameful” actions of Queen Wilhemina during the occupation about the same time that prime minister Mark Rutte publicly apologized for the Holocaust.(I) The debate still suggests that the “memory of perpetrators” is difficult to just integrate into an idea “state normalization after a conflict, in particular when these collaborators were state organizations(3).  </span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2193,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2193","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-09-23T11:03:04+00:00","modified":"2019-09-23T11:03:04+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":24,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/24","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2193","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":3,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2193","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"OD

It was established in 1939, after the Dutch borders were closed down for refugees by the government, as a central refugee camp for Jews who fled from Germany and Anschluss Austria. In total, after Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933, almost 32,000 German Jews found refuge in the Netherlands, some 10,000 after the 1938 November or Kristallnacht pogroms. At the beginning of the German occupation in May 1940 it hosted only 750 refugees, but when the Nazis turned the refugee camp into a transit camp in July 1942 the camp was enlarged with new barracks for Dutch Jews. Already since February 1941 Dutch and German Jews were caught by Nazi raids (razzia’s) in the Amsterdam Judenviertel and in other cities, but from July 1942 until the beginning of the railway strike of September 1944 the Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager Westerbork served that function. In close cooperation with the Amsterdam Jewish Council (Joodse Raad) at about 107,000 (of a total of 145,000 Dutch Jews), and 245 Sinti and Roma, of 97 transports were selected for weekly deportations to concentration and extermination camps in Germany and Eastern Europe, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau and Sobibor. The façade of a seemingly peaceful place where people waited in fear on the deadly transports was described in painful details by the Dutch journalist Philip Mechanicus in his camp diary In Depot and in the letters and diaries of Etty Hillesum, and filmed by the German-Jewish photographer Rudolf Breslauer for his 1944 Westerbork film, of which the footage (since 2017 registered as UNESCO Memory of the World) contains the only known real-life moving images of a Nazi train transport. Only 5,000 deportees survived the war. After Poland, the Germans were nowhere more successful in the extermination of Jews than in the Netherlands.  Yet the camp was controlled by only a few German SS officers, with help of some SS trained volunteers from German and Amsterdam police battalions and the Dutch Waffen SS, housed in the nearby SS camp Hooghalen, or Heidelager. The Dutch military police (Marechaussee) continued to guard the camp inside, assisted by a Jewish camp police. The latter, the OD (Ordnungsdienst), distinctive in their green overalls (since 1943) who had to help with the transports, garnered the worst reputation among Dutch Jewish inmates as the ‘Jewish SS’.  Westerbork underwent a new transformation after the liberation, when between 1945 and 1948 it came to serve as an internment camp for members of the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB), SS volunteers and other people suspected of having collaborated with the Nazis. It also briefly served as a training base for soldiers during the Indonesian War of Independence  (1945-1949) and a camp for Dutch repatriates from the Dutch Indies. From 1951 to 1970 the camp, renamed Schattenberg, became the residence of a large part of former Moluccan soldiers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army  (KNIL) with their families, who left the island of Ambon after the Indonesian repression of their independence movement. Two decades after living in the camp, the Moluccans saw their camp demolished after the government approved the project of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on the campscape. The Schattenberg community was relocated to surrounding villages. With the exception of the camp commander’s house and the 1949 Resistance Monument, the campscape was already half empty when in 1970 the National Monument Camp Westerbork was unveiled, and in 1983, three kilometres away from the silence zone, the Memorial Centre  Camp Westerbork was opened. From then on Jewish survivors held regular commemorations and the annual number of visitors rose constantly, reaching 180,000 in 2019. Since 2000 the Memorial Center has made room for research and presentations on the wider biography of the site, but confronted itself in 2008 with strong protests against its temporary exhibition of the NSB period, after which the museum and the “holy ground” of the campscape have become separated spaces, the latter mainly dedicated to Holocaust commemoration. Yet, within the current context of a growing competition of Holocaust and postcolonial memories, and the refugee issue, the memorialization of the various groups which went through Westerbork and Schattenberg, and their divergent experiences including the role of the perpetrators, remains contested up to today.

With a familiar face the cover, that of the girl peeking out intently for something or someone as the carrigage doors close during the transport out of Westerbork (1). Wagenaar attempted to find out who the girl was and in doing so “undo” the anonymization of the victims of the Holocaust. The girl, however anonymous, was not unknown, however.  She was perhaps the most well known still of the so called Westerbork movie, a footage filmed in the camp in 1943 by order of commander Gemmeker and for better than six decades, the girl stood for the Jewish children lost in the brutalities of the Holocaust. But, as in the case of the movie itself, despite the wealthy material offered by this only authentic footage inside a Nazi concentration camps, anonimity and misappropriations seem to have marked the afterlife of this victim. Wagenaar reached a surprising conclusion, after a long search in the Netherlands and abroad, as he did gave the girl back her name: Settela Steinbach.

style=\"font-weight:400;\">Wagenaar’s quest is interesting out of a number of reasons which have to do with the memory dynamics around the Roma Holocaust, or Porajmos (the “Devouring”). The first is evident in the uncertain number of victims, which today still ranges from 250000 to 1,5 million, a reality which has to do with the lack of censuses before, the destruction of Nazi records but also with the politics of memory regarding this episode. Several authors have pointed to the forgetting of this side of the Holocaust, also determined by the contemporary politics of exclusion that the community still faces. Indeed, there is a peculiar dynamics around the way the Porajmos is remembered. If Settela is known today, not the same can be said about the context which led to her death. This type of historical representation, personalized and obviously an attempt to focus on the victim often leaves a blankspot in the understanding of the why the roots of the Sinti and Roma during the racial persecutions of the Nazi regime .Although the Rromani Holocaust continues to be debated, often denied, more often than not minimized, the existing debates have focused first and foremost on the recognition of the extent of the repression against the Roma and its place in the history of the Holocaust.</span></p>\n<p>From 1899 through the Nazis' ascension in 1933, German legislators introduced law after law to restrict the rights of the Roma by surveilling them, keeping them out of public areas, and limiting the places where they could settle. Laws forbade them from entering many swimming pools or parks and whole sections of the country were off-limits for them. Police even had the right to arrest virtually any Roma they wanted without cause. The prevailing thinking was that any time a Gypsy was behind bars, the country was a safer place.</p>\n<p>Unlike other survivors of the Holocaust, the Roma survivors hardly received any recognition or reparations for the suffering they had endured. In fact, even after the Nazis' reign ended in 1945, racism against the Roma endured to the point that some argued they didn't deserve any redress for the genocide.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2027,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2027","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:22:59+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:22:59+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2027","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":2,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2027","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Roma caravans","copyright":"Memorial Centre Camp Westerbork.","files":[{"id":711,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/711","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/02238caa04270dfb7a7666aa060c633c.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/02238caa04270dfb7a7666aa060c633c.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/02238caa04270dfb7a7666aa060c633c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/02238caa04270dfb7a7666aa060c633c.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T07:23:00+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:04:19+00:00","filename":"02238caa04270dfb7a7666aa060c633c.jpg","authentication":"797e5f0f918bcbadb5d9ac3a331a0faf","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"RomaCaravans.jpg","size":18622,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":400,"resolution_y":261,"compression_ratio":0.059457215836526}},"item":{"id":2027,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2027","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":2,"exhibitId":42,"exhibitSlug":"enduring-exclusions-of-the-rom","exhibitTitle":"Enduring exclusions of the Roma"},{"paragraph":7,"exhibitId":42,"exhibitSlug":"enduring-exclusions-of-the-rom","exhibitTitle":"Enduring exclusions of the Roma"}]},"file":{"id":711,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/711","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/02238caa04270dfb7a7666aa060c633c.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/02238caa04270dfb7a7666aa060c633c.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/02238caa04270dfb7a7666aa060c633c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/02238caa04270dfb7a7666aa060c633c.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T07:23:00+00:00","modified":"2019-11-07T22:04:19+00:00","filename":"02238caa04270dfb7a7666aa060c633c.jpg","authentication":"797e5f0f918bcbadb5d9ac3a331a0faf","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"RomaCaravans.jpg","size":18622,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":400,"resolution_y":261,"compression_ratio":0.059457215836526}},"item":{"id":2027,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2027","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}}]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":200,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/200","title":"paragraph 3","slug":"paragraph-3","order":3,"exhibit":{"id":42,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/42"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":401,"page_id":200,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The memory politics around the Porajmos weaves in seamlessly with the genesis and endurance of politics of exclusion almost 70 years ago.

Interestingly, it was the same status and term which led to the repression during the war. The ‘asocial” denomination had, in fact, a longer history in defining an exceptional and criminalized status in the interwar period. Indeed, same as many others, the “Dutch” girl fled Germany together with her family to escape their status as were pariahs, criminalized by policies of sterilization under the „Law for the prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring”. In 1935 they were even stripped of their German citizenship.  But the term verged from the social denomination to a political perspective across Europe and was however more widely employed at the time, in a discourse which had to do with the interest in social ordering and principles. Two sites in this project, Westerbork and Falstad, are relevant to understand the usage of the term, as many of the “asocial youth”, some of them early refugees, would finally reach Westerbork. Falstad, in Norway, was an educational facility in the 1930s for “asocial” youth, expected to be reintegrated in society through means which were often considered abusive by witnesses and subjects of interest.</span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1952,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1952","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T07:18:25+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T07:18:25+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1952","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":2,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=1952","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Article about identification of Settela, 1994","description":"Girl in cattle wagon identified, 1994.

The Roma were then a symbolic category, but ambivalent particularly because of their refusal to abide by the promises of the new regime. It is illustrative that the Roma site of Lety was memorialized already ten years after the war. The 1960, the Czechoslovak government fonded a film on the Lety camp, “Don’t forget about that little girl” speaking about the deportations in 1942 and 1943 (5).

It was established in 1939, after the Dutch borders were closed down for refugees by the government, as a central refugee camp for Jews who fled from Germany and Anschluss Austria. In total, after Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933, almost 32,000 German Jews found refuge in the Netherlands, some 10,000 after the 1938 November or Kristallnacht pogroms. At the beginning of the German occupation in May 1940 it hosted only 750 refugees, but when the Nazis turned the refugee camp into a transit camp in July 1942 the camp was enlarged with new barracks for Dutch Jews. Already since February 1941 Dutch and German Jews were caught by Nazi raids (razzia’s) in the Amsterdam Judenviertel and in other cities, but from July 1942 until the beginning of the railway strike of September 1944 the Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager Westerbork served that function. In close cooperation with the Amsterdam Jewish Council (Joodse Raad) at about 107,000 (of a total of 145,000 Dutch Jews), and 245 Sinti and Roma, of 97 transports were selected for weekly deportations to concentration and extermination camps in Germany and Eastern Europe, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau and Sobibor. The façade of a seemingly peaceful place where people waited in fear on the deadly transports was described in painful details by the Dutch journalist Philip Mechanicus in his camp diary In Depot and in the letters and diaries of Etty Hillesum, and filmed by the German-Jewish photographer Rudolf Breslauer for his 1944 Westerbork film, of which the footage (since 2017 registered as UNESCO Memory of the World) contains the only known real-life moving images of a Nazi train transport. Only 5,000 deportees survived the war. After Poland, the Germans were nowhere more successful in the extermination of Jews than in the Netherlands.  Yet the camp was controlled by only a few German SS officers, with help of some SS trained volunteers from German and Amsterdam police battalions and the Dutch Waffen SS, housed in the nearby SS camp Hooghalen, or Heidelager. The Dutch military police (Marechaussee) continued to guard the camp inside, assisted by a Jewish camp police. The latter, the OD (Ordnungsdienst), distinctive in their green overalls (since 1943) who had to help with the transports, garnered the worst reputation among Dutch Jewish inmates as the ‘Jewish SS’.  Westerbork underwent a new transformation after the liberation, when between 1945 and 1948 it came to serve as an internment camp for members of the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB), SS volunteers and other people suspected of having collaborated with the Nazis. It also briefly served as a training base for soldiers during the Indonesian War of Independence  (1945-1949) and a camp for Dutch repatriates from the Dutch Indies. From 1951 to 1970 the camp, renamed Schattenberg, became the residence of a large part of former Moluccan soldiers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army  (KNIL) with their families, who left the island of Ambon after the Indonesian repression of their independence movement. Two decades after living in the camp, the Moluccans saw their camp demolished after the government approved the project of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on the campscape. The Schattenberg community was relocated to surrounding villages. With the exception of the camp commander’s house and the 1949 Resistance Monument, the campscape was already half empty when in 1970 the National Monument Camp Westerbork was unveiled, and in 1983, three kilometres away from the silence zone, the Memorial Centre  Camp Westerbork was opened. From then on Jewish survivors held regular commemorations and the annual number of visitors rose constantly, reaching 180,000 in 2019. Since 2000 the Memorial Center has made room for research and presentations on the wider biography of the site, but confronted itself in 2008 with strong protests against its temporary exhibition of the NSB period, after which the museum and the “holy ground” of the campscape have become separated spaces, the latter mainly dedicated to Holocaust commemoration. Yet, within the current context of a growing competition of Holocaust and postcolonial memories, and the refugee issue, the memorialization of the various groups which went through Westerbork and Schattenberg, and their divergent experiences including the role of the perpetrators, remains contested up to today.

During the war, Jasenovac was the largest complex of concentration, incarceration, forced labour and death camps scattered in the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska - NDH), a fascist puppet state. Between 1941 and 1945, the Roman-Catholic Croatian Ustaše with the help of their followers (among them Bosnian Muslims recruited by the Waffen SS) systematically exterminated Jews, Roma, Serbs, Croats and others who opposed Ustaše ideology.  Although contested and subject to continuous politically charged debates, the number of (registered) victims of Jasenovac currently established by the Croat Jasenovac Memorial Site stands at 83,811.\r\nAfter WWII and the imposition of state socialism in Yugoslavia, the camp came to symbolize the “glorious anti-fascist struggle” captured in Tito’s slogan of “Brotherhood and Unity”, which aimed to aid postwar inter-ethnic consensus. This was reflected in the now-iconic “Stone Flower” monument designed by Bogdan Bogdanovic which was inaugurated, along with a museum, at the location of the former Camp III (Brickworks) in 1968. Although Jasenovac was the most important site of commemoration in Yugoslavia, the nature of the regime did not allow sufficient agency for independent scholarship related to this campscape and the crimes of WWII in general. In the wake of new wars in the 1990s, the number of Jasenovac victims (which had already been overestimated since 1946 in order to justify large wartime reparations from Germany), soon became a key element in the political use of memory. In the 1980s and 1990s, new national tensions in the former Yugoslavia came to be analysed through the prism of past conflicts, creating a new set of propaganda activities and manipulations with regards to the number of victims and visual representations of the Jasenovac tragedy. In 1988, a second permanent exhibition was opened, full of nationalist undertones that fueled ethnic tensions and divisions between Serbs and Croats. This exhibition was demolished during the 1990s dissolution wars. At the same time, the former camp Stara Gradiška (one of Jasenovac’s sub camps) with its torture centre “Hotel Gagro”, was reused as a prison camp in Yugoslavia and as a camp during the 1990s.\r\nAfter the 1990s wars, the contested legacy of Jasenovac continued to be reflected in the spatial division of the terrain of the former main camp, located on two sides of the River Sava - a national border established in 1991 - which nowadays marks the boundary between Croatia and Republika Srpska, a predominantly Serbian part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the accession of Croatia to the European Union in 2013, this border further separates - politically and symbolically - the 28th EU member state from other countries in the former Yugoslavia. A new permanent exhibition opened in 2006 on the Croatian side at the Jasenovac Memorial Site. On the Republika Srpska side, the Donja Gradina Memorial encapsulates the largest mass killing and mass burial site of the Jasenovac complex, with more than 150 marked and unmarked graves. Established in the 1980s, the site still informs visitors that 700,000 people were murdered in Jasenovac, a figure based on statistics already instrumentalized by Serbian politics in the 1980s and used to wage war against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the 1990s, right-wing Croatian nationalists and Holocaust deniers have continued to downgrade the number of Jasenovac victims and the nature of the camp. They have also suggested that Jasenovac was a postwar communist camp housing a higher number of prisoners than the Ustaše camp, even though the Brickworks camp was already demolished in 1945. The Jasenovac Memorial Site nowadays promotes the individualization of victims as an alternative to the former politicization of the past and the use of photos showing mass deaths. However, in doing so, it finds itself regularly confronted with revisionist responses to the past.

Castuera camp, located in southwest Spain, is one of the nearly two hundred concentration camps that existed during the civil war (1936-1939) and the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco (1939-1975). This camp serves as an example of how the concealed and recent traumatic past in Spain has mobilized the claims of victims’ groups, activists, historical memory associations, political parties and academics for the implementation of an official memory and memorialization politics that recognizes and addresses the experience of victims of Francoist violence.\r\nIn March 1939, before the imminent end of the war, the rebel Francoist army used two battalions of republican workers (POW) for the construction of the camp. The camp functioned for one year, between March 1939 and 1940. Its main functions were the classification, reeducation and elimination of those considered the enemies of the new regime after the coup d’état against the legitimate government of the Second Republic (1931-1939) on 17 July 1936. It has been estimated that between 15,000 to 20,000 prisoners went through the camp, which included civilians and militaries from different regions of the country. \r\nInside the Camp, detainees were segregated into different barracks. Political personalities shared the space with left-wing trade union leaders, republican council officials, army officers and members of guerrilla groups, among others. Many of them were executed as part of the political cleansing carried out by the new authorities. All traces of them were lost in the concentration camp. The inmates that survived were often (re)integrated into the social fabric of the so-called “New Spain” through forced labor and a process of “re-education.” Thousands of them embarked on a journey, which, in the best-case scenario, took them to other concentration camps, prisons or forced labour camps. These repressive centres utilized a technology of pain to realize their aims of humiliation and punishment. Starvation, illness, epidemics and torture characterized the living conditions in the camps and prisons. \r\nIn January 1940, a small group of inmates escaped from the camp and arrived in France. Far from the fate they expected, they were once again turned into prisoners, detained in a different concentration camp and forced to integrate the Foreign Legion or workers’ battalions. Other half-million Spaniards who fled to France trying to escape from Franco's repression suffered the same fate. Nearly 14,000 Spanish refugees died due to the extreme conditions of the French camps. From here, more than 9,000 prisoners were sent to Nazi concentration camps, and approximately 5,500 died throughout Europe. \r\nThe infrastructure of the camp in Castuera was dismantled at the beginning of April 1940. After it ceased to operate, the camp fell into oblivion, undergoing a similar process to those who endured its violence during the dictatorship. With the “pact of forgetting” and the Amnesty Law of 1977 the silence over the episodes that took place at the site continued throughout part of the current democratic period. In 2004, the screening of the documentary “The nightmare of Castuera” to a primetime television audience marked a turning point in the visibility of the camp. From this moment, the Association for the Memory of Castuera Concentration Camp has led the most important actions connected to the memory and recognition of the camp and the victims of Francoist repression in the area. In 2009, after high pressure from the civil society and academics, the privately own land of the camp received the most important heritage protection classification in Spain as Site of Cultural Interest. Despite its new official categorization, the area continues to be used for extensive stockbreeding today.\r\nArchaeological investigations undertaken at the site between 2010 and 2012 and the exhumations of two mass graves that contained the corpses of prisoners from the camp have revealed important information about the functioning of the site and the repressive processes suffered by prisoners. In January 2019, a new law was approved for the recognition of the victims and the implementation of a specific memory politics in the region of Extremadura. However, despite these new developments, the place remains invisible in the space where it exists, unfathomed in the collective memory of society still today. The camp in Castuera, as it is the case for all of Franco’s concentration camps, still awaits the creation of a documentation centre intended to interpret and disseminate the history and memory of the repression exerted inside and outside its fences.","files":[]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":49,"exhibitSlug":"unearthing-the-hidden-past-in-","exhibitTitle":"Unearthing the hidden past in Castuera concentration camp"}]},"tags":["Human Remains","Materiality","Forensic","Evidence","Silencing memory","Claims of victimhood"],"creator":["Laura Muñoz-Encinar"]},{"id":50,"title":"Trials to Dinko Šakić and Živan Kuveždić: evaluating transitional justice","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/50","slug":"trials-to-dinko---aki---and---","description":"","credits":"collaboration, communism/socialism, Holocaust, perpetrators, purges, transitional justice, retributions, trials","featured":false,"public":false,"added":"2019-11-23T11:58:24+00:00","modified":"2019-11-23T12:38:26+00:00","owner":{"id":30,"resource":"users","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/30"},"pages":[{"id":265,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/265","title":"Page 1","slug":"page-1","order":1,"exhibit":{"id":50,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/50"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":468,"page_id":265,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>During a hearing in 1999, the former Ustaše commander Dinko Šakić remained utterly calm and assured of his innocence, despite the shootings, hangings and starvations occurring under his “leadership” of the main camp III Brickworks in 1944 in the Jasenovac concentration camp.

Comparing Kuvedžić´s and Šakić´s trial, Kuveždić was convicted in early communist period of Socialist Yugoslavia, during the undemocratic and totalitarian regime, while Šakić was convicted in democratic system in the Republic of Croatia. Thus we can state that Kuveždić received the most severe punishment for the incomparable less responsibility than Šakić, who, due to the passage of time and of another legal system, was sentenced to, conditionally speaking, milder punishment . The trials of Šakić and Kuveždić plainly point to the contested politics of memory of collaboration in Yugoslavia and Croatia, and histories of biased judicial mechanisms for wartime collaborators and the post-war retribution processes.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2336,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2336","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-11-22T15:08:18+00:00","modified":"2019-11-22T15:08:18+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":30,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/30","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2336","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":275,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/275","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"A photo of Živan Kuveždić","description":"Živan Kuveždić with his friend (stands in the middle)","copyright":"Vladimir Geiger and Suzana Leček, Crime and Punishment (rights given to the project to publish this document)","files":[{"id":954,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/954","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/3cd98ca292afbe18bf6254ef992f8485.png","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-11-22T15:08:18+00:00","modified":"2019-11-22T15:08:18+00:00","filename":"3cd98ca292afbe18bf6254ef992f8485.png","authentication":"ca26a0671262421ab9475f0c57758f92","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"image/png","order":null,"original_filename":"photo Živan Kuveždić (middle).png","size":1744238,"stored":true,"type_os":"PNG image data, 1787 x 2731, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/png","video":{"dataformat":"png","lossless":false,"resolution_x":1787,"resolution_y":2731,"bits_per_sample":24,"compression_ratio":0.1191346892754},"comments":{"XML:com.adobe.xmp":["<x:xmpmeta xmlns:x=\"adobe:ns:meta/\" x:xmptk=\"XMP Core 5.4.0\">\n   <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\">\n      <rdf:Description rdf:about=\"\"\n            xmlns:xmp=\"http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/\"\n            xmlns:tiff=\"http://ns.adobe.com/tiff/1.0/\">\n         <xmp:CreatorTool>paint.net 4.1.1</xmp:CreatorTool>\n         <tiff:ResolutionUnit>2</tiff:ResolutionUnit>\n         <tiff:Compression>5</tiff:Compression>\n         <tiff:Orientation>1</tiff:Orientation>\n         <tiff:PhotometricInterpretation>2</tiff:PhotometricInterpretation>\n      </rdf:Description>\n   </rdf:RDF>\n</x:xmpmeta>"]},"comments_html":{"XML:com.adobe.xmp":["&lt;x:xmpmeta xmlns:x=&quot;adobe:ns:meta/&quot;

During the war, Jasenovac was the largest complex of concentration, incarceration, forced labour and death camps scattered in the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska - NDH), a fascist puppet state. Between 1941 and 1945, the Roman-Catholic Croatian Ustaše with the help of their followers (among them Bosnian Muslims recruited by the Waffen SS) systematically exterminated Jews, Roma, Serbs, Croats and others who opposed Ustaše ideology.  Although contested and subject to continuous politically charged debates, the number of (registered) victims of Jasenovac currently established by the Croat Jasenovac Memorial Site stands at 83,811.\r\nAfter WWII and the imposition of state socialism in Yugoslavia, the camp came to symbolize the “glorious anti-fascist struggle” captured in Tito’s slogan of “Brotherhood and Unity”, which aimed to aid postwar inter-ethnic consensus. This was reflected in the now-iconic “Stone Flower” monument designed by Bogdan Bogdanovic which was inaugurated, along with a museum, at the location of the former Camp III (Brickworks) in 1968. Although Jasenovac was the most important site of commemoration in Yugoslavia, the nature of the regime did not allow sufficient agency for independent scholarship related to this campscape and the crimes of WWII in general. In the wake of new wars in the 1990s, the number of Jasenovac victims (which had already been overestimated since 1946 in order to justify large wartime reparations from Germany), soon became a key element in the political use of memory. In the 1980s and 1990s, new national tensions in the former Yugoslavia came to be analysed through the prism of past conflicts, creating a new set of propaganda activities and manipulations with regards to the number of victims and visual representations of the Jasenovac tragedy. In 1988, a second permanent exhibition was opened, full of nationalist undertones that fueled ethnic tensions and divisions between Serbs and Croats. This exhibition was demolished during the 1990s dissolution wars. At the same time, the former camp Stara Gradiška (one of Jasenovac’s sub camps) with its torture centre “Hotel Gagro”, was reused as a prison camp in Yugoslavia and as a camp during the 1990s.\r\nAfter the 1990s wars, the contested legacy of Jasenovac continued to be reflected in the spatial division of the terrain of the former main camp, located on two sides of the River Sava - a national border established in 1991 - which nowadays marks the boundary between Croatia and Republika Srpska, a predominantly Serbian part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the accession of Croatia to the European Union in 2013, this border further separates - politically and symbolically - the 28th EU member state from other countries in the former Yugoslavia. A new permanent exhibition opened in 2006 on the Croatian side at the Jasenovac Memorial Site. On the Republika Srpska side, the Donja Gradina Memorial encapsulates the largest mass killing and mass burial site of the Jasenovac complex, with more than 150 marked and unmarked graves. Established in the 1980s, the site still informs visitors that 700,000 people were murdered in Jasenovac, a figure based on statistics already instrumentalized by Serbian politics in the 1980s and used to wage war against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the 1990s, right-wing Croatian nationalists and Holocaust deniers have continued to downgrade the number of Jasenovac victims and the nature of the camp. They have also suggested that Jasenovac was a postwar communist camp housing a higher number of prisoners than the Ustaše camp, even though the Brickworks camp was already demolished in 1945. The Jasenovac Memorial Site nowadays promotes the individualization of victims as an alternative to the former politicization of the past and the use of photos showing mass deaths. However, in doing so, it finds itself regularly confronted with revisionist responses to the past.

During the war, Jasenovac was the largest complex of concentration, incarceration, forced labour and death camps scattered in the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska - NDH), a fascist puppet state. Between 1941 and 1945, the Roman-Catholic Croatian Ustaše with the help of their followers (among them Bosnian Muslims recruited by the Waffen SS) systematically exterminated Jews, Roma, Serbs, Croats and others who opposed Ustaše ideology.  Although contested and subject to continuous politically charged debates, the number of (registered) victims of Jasenovac currently established by the Croat Jasenovac Memorial Site stands at 83,811.\r\nAfter WWII and the imposition of state socialism in Yugoslavia, the camp came to symbolize the “glorious anti-fascist struggle” captured in Tito’s slogan of “Brotherhood and Unity”, which aimed to aid postwar inter-ethnic consensus. This was reflected in the now-iconic “Stone Flower” monument designed by Bogdan Bogdanovic which was inaugurated, along with a museum, at the location of the former Camp III (Brickworks) in 1968. Although Jasenovac was the most important site of commemoration in Yugoslavia, the nature of the regime did not allow sufficient agency for independent scholarship related to this campscape and the crimes of WWII in general. In the wake of new wars in the 1990s, the number of Jasenovac victims (which had already been overestimated since 1946 in order to justify large wartime reparations from Germany), soon became a key element in the political use of memory. In the 1980s and 1990s, new national tensions in the former Yugoslavia came to be analysed through the prism of past conflicts, creating a new set of propaganda activities and manipulations with regards to the number of victims and visual representations of the Jasenovac tragedy. In 1988, a second permanent exhibition was opened, full of nationalist undertones that fueled ethnic tensions and divisions between Serbs and Croats. This exhibition was demolished during the 1990s dissolution wars. At the same time, the former camp Stara Gradiška (one of Jasenovac’s sub camps) with its torture centre “Hotel Gagro”, was reused as a prison camp in Yugoslavia and as a camp during the 1990s.\r\nAfter the 1990s wars, the contested legacy of Jasenovac continued to be reflected in the spatial division of the terrain of the former main camp, located on two sides of the River Sava - a national border established in 1991 - which nowadays marks the boundary between Croatia and Republika Srpska, a predominantly Serbian part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the accession of Croatia to the European Union in 2013, this border further separates - politically and symbolically - the 28th EU member state from other countries in the former Yugoslavia. A new permanent exhibition opened in 2006 on the Croatian side at the Jasenovac Memorial Site. On the Republika Srpska side, the Donja Gradina Memorial encapsulates the largest mass killing and mass burial site of the Jasenovac complex, with more than 150 marked and unmarked graves. Established in the 1980s, the site still informs visitors that 700,000 people were murdered in Jasenovac, a figure based on statistics already instrumentalized by Serbian politics in the 1980s and used to wage war against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the 1990s, right-wing Croatian nationalists and Holocaust deniers have continued to downgrade the number of Jasenovac victims and the nature of the camp. They have also suggested that Jasenovac was a postwar communist camp housing a higher number of prisoners than the Ustaše camp, even though the Brickworks camp was already demolished in 1945. The Jasenovac Memorial Site nowadays promotes the individualization of victims as an alternative to the former politicization of the past and the use of photos showing mass deaths. However, in doing so, it finds itself regularly confronted with revisionist responses to the past.   \r\n","files":[]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":47,"exhibitSlug":"visualising-stara-gradi--ka---","exhibitTitle":"Visualising Stara Gradiška’s Penal Landscape"},{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":50,"exhibitSlug":"trials-to-dinko---aki---and---","exhibitTitle":"Trials to Dinko Šakić and Živan Kuveždić: evaluating transitional justice"},{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":51,"exhibitSlug":"suffering-of-the-roma-in-the-i","exhibitTitle":"Suffering of the Roma in the Independent State of Croatia: Forgotten People on the Sidelines of Croatian History"},{"paragraph":1,"exhibitId":52,"exhibitSlug":"the-war-on-numbers--the-presen","exhibitTitle":"The war on numbers: the presence of Jasenovac in Serbian and Croatian politics of memory"}]},"tags":["Roma","Porajmos","genocide","Holocaust","commemoration","suffering"],"creator":[]},{"id":52,"title":"The war on numbers: the presence of Jasenovac in Serbian and Croatian politics of memory","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/52","slug":"the-war-on-numbers--the-presen","description":"","credits":"revisionism, nationalism, communism/socialism, claims to victimhood, victim-centred narratives, “number wars”, Serbia, Croatia","featured":false,"public":false,"added":"2019-11-23T12:45:49+00:00","modified":"2019-11-23T12:45:49+00:00","owner":{"id":30,"resource":"users","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/30"},"pages":[{"id":289,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/289","title":"Page 1","slug":"page-1","order":2,"exhibit":{"id":52,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/52"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":492,"page_id":289,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>On 22<sup>nd</sup> of March 2019, new theatre play “Eichmann in Jerusalem” was premiered in Zagreb.

During the war, Jasenovac was the largest complex of concentration, incarceration, forced labour and death camps scattered in the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska - NDH), a fascist puppet state. Between 1941 and 1945, the Roman-Catholic Croatian Ustaše with the help of their followers (among them Bosnian Muslims recruited by the Waffen SS) systematically exterminated Jews, Roma, Serbs, Croats and others who opposed Ustaše ideology.  Although contested and subject to continuous politically charged debates, the number of (registered) victims of Jasenovac currently established by the Croat Jasenovac Memorial Site stands at 83,811.\r\nAfter WWII and the imposition of state socialism in Yugoslavia, the camp came to symbolize the “glorious anti-fascist struggle” captured in Tito’s slogan of “Brotherhood and Unity”, which aimed to aid postwar inter-ethnic consensus. This was reflected in the now-iconic “Stone Flower” monument designed by Bogdan Bogdanovic which was inaugurated, along with a museum, at the location of the former Camp III (Brickworks) in 1968. Although Jasenovac was the most important site of commemoration in Yugoslavia, the nature of the regime did not allow sufficient agency for independent scholarship related to this campscape and the crimes of WWII in general. In the wake of new wars in the 1990s, the number of Jasenovac victims (which had already been overestimated since 1946 in order to justify large wartime reparations from Germany), soon became a key element in the political use of memory. In the 1980s and 1990s, new national tensions in the former Yugoslavia came to be analysed through the prism of past conflicts, creating a new set of propaganda activities and manipulations with regards to the number of victims and visual representations of the Jasenovac tragedy. In 1988, a second permanent exhibition was opened, full of nationalist undertones that fueled ethnic tensions and divisions between Serbs and Croats. This exhibition was demolished during the 1990s dissolution wars. At the same time, the former camp Stara Gradiška (one of Jasenovac’s sub camps) with its torture centre “Hotel Gagro”, was reused as a prison camp in Yugoslavia and as a camp during the 1990s.\r\nAfter the 1990s wars, the contested legacy of Jasenovac continued to be reflected in the spatial division of the terrain of the former main camp, located on two sides of the River Sava - a national border established in 1991 - which nowadays marks the boundary between Croatia and Republika Srpska, a predominantly Serbian part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the accession of Croatia to the European Union in 2013, this border further separates - politically and symbolically - the 28th EU member state from other countries in the former Yugoslavia. A new permanent exhibition opened in 2006 on the Croatian side at the Jasenovac Memorial Site. On the Republika Srpska side, the Donja Gradina Memorial encapsulates the largest mass killing and mass burial site of the Jasenovac complex, with more than 150 marked and unmarked graves. Established in the 1980s, the site still informs visitors that 700,000 people were murdered in Jasenovac, a figure based on statistics already instrumentalized by Serbian politics in the 1980s and used to wage war against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the 1990s, right-wing Croatian nationalists and Holocaust deniers have continued to downgrade the number of Jasenovac victims and the nature of the camp. They have also suggested that Jasenovac was a postwar communist camp housing a higher number of prisoners than the Ustaše camp, even though the Brickworks camp was already demolished in 1945. The Jasenovac Memorial Site nowadays promotes the individualization of victims as an alternative to the former politicization of the past and the use of photos showing mass deaths. However, in doing so, it finds itself regularly confronted with revisionist responses to the past.   \r\n","files":[]},"linkedPages":[{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":47,"exhibitSlug":"visualising-stara-gradi--ka---","exhibitTitle":"Visualising Stara Gradiška’s Penal Landscape"},{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":50,"exhibitSlug":"trials-to-dinko---aki---and---","exhibitTitle":"Trials to Dinko Šakić and Živan Kuveždić: evaluating transitional justice"},{"paragraph":0,"exhibitId":51,"exhibitSlug":"suffering-of-the-roma-in-the-i","exhibitTitle":"Suffering of the Roma in the Independent State of Croatia: Forgotten People on the Sidelines of Croatian History"},{"paragraph":1,"exhibitId":52,"exhibitSlug":"the-war-on-numbers--the-presen","exhibitTitle":"The war on numbers: the presence of Jasenovac in Serbian and Croatian politics of memory"}]},"tags":["revisionism","nationalism","communism/socialism","claims to victimhood","victim-centred narratives","“number wars”","Serbia","Croatia"],"creator":[]}]
